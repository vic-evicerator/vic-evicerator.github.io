Happy new year, all.

For the past two years, I've posted my musical New Year's Resolutions here so that others could berate me for not meeting them. I met all of my 2006 resolutions. 2007 resolutions? Not so much. Let's begin by reviewing last year's resolutions and assess how well I did with them: \* - _I WILL finish the next Death Beast album before half this year is out._ - Well, I blew this one. Big time.

\* - _I WILL finish the mixing/mastering of *Bellum Aeternum* post-haste._ - I did this. I had it done by April or something like that, I think. Of course, I had to finish it before I could build my new computer, which probably had something to do with it. (And then Halo, Quake 4, Doom 3, Call of Duty 2, etc. probably had something to do with the first one too...)

\* - _I WILL begin working on both Dauder Sofa AND *Letters From Hell*. I will have at least one song for each done by the end of February._ - Hahahahahah... DS has somewhat been retired or recombined or something, that's how slack I was on that. LFH - well, I'll get to that in a minute...

\* - _I WILL get more stuff released on UHR._ - After I got Demontage and Black Torment done I got the Death Beast demo comp and the Rampage/Chemikiller split Venom tribute done, so I feel okay about that. The Vrolok "Nocturnal Isolation" reissue is coming soon as well (Masters are here), and I have some other stuff in the pipes as well...

\* - _I WILL get the ADR/UHR newsletter started._ - One of my unqualified successes. January 13 I sent out the first issue of "Breath of the Dragon", and monthly after that for about 10 or so issues. Since then, of course, ADR has been laid to rest, largely making it obsolete, though it will most likely be reborn in some form as I still have UHR to contend with.

\* - _and, for fun and practice, I WILL record a couple of Dire Straits covers._ - I got drum files done for two songs, but never got around to recording anything. Yet. So, I'm shooting somewhere around 50/50, with some generosity and some bending. So, what do I resolve to get done for 2008?

- I will finish and release Death Beast _The Onslaught_
- I will finish some tracks for _Letters from Hell_
- I will get at least three new UHR releases out by mid-year, and hopefully more by the end of the year
- For error-correction, I will post here much more frequently, with updates

And the rest, I'll just wing it.

*(And, looking at the promise list at the end, it would seem 50/50 was my high-water mark for new year's resolutions. In fact, all I made progress on was UHR releases, and then I only had two - the Undimensional album and the Vrolok "Nocturnal Isolation" reissue. And even those were already half-done in 2007. Pretty embarrassing, really, but I shouldn't let the fact that I didn't get much of my own music recorded or written overshadow the fact that the 50% I did get done in 2007 was a LOT of label and distro work. I take solace in that - I actually took advice from my own music - I went out with a bang, not a whimper.)*

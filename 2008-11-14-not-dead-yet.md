I'd love to say I've been hard at work on new music of some form for you all.

But the truth is that I've only been working hard at trying to work on new music. Still, these months of hammering have me something like about halfway done with *The Onslaught*, and the ball is still in Aerik's court on the Rampage side of things.

But with my food job on the upswing, I've not had much time for UHR, the Rampage tribute, or other projects I've been working on idly for ages now. Respite? Not any time soon, unfortunately, and that makes me only more lazy and un-motivated when time manages to free up for working on music... and with those creative times getting farther and farther apart, the creative juices dry up like, well, many unsavory dry metaphors I could come up with.

But I'm not dead yet. Stay tuned.

*(As the posting history showed, I wasn't dead, but I was on life support in ICU, metaphorically speaking. As I posted back in April 2008, Aerik was 'almost done' with that EP, and you see that this is November 2008. That kind of delay always takes its toll, and in the most pernicious way. "Well, I'm kinda done for now, and it's been so long that another day won't hurt...."*

*Well, you see what seven months of saying 'another day won't hurt' gets you.)*

Sorry for the long delay, but after a year of hand-conversion and learning to program in an entirely new environment, my personal website and blog are now back online. Anyone familiar with my history usually notes that I make big announcements for small changes, tease 'more info soon', then drag my feet delivering. I'll try to break that cycle now.

For the moment, this is more a proof of concept, since using Jekyll to build my site/blog is new to me, and some of the funcionality I can only test as it's live, so if this works, then things really SHOULD go more quickly.

But then, we all know what a shitshow 2020 has been, which is when this whole thing first fell apart, just before the whole fucking world did as well. And that's a story I'm actually eager to tell, as well as catch you up on what a whole year of pandemic has done to the least-hard-working-man in show business.

But for now, just cross your fingers and hope this works.

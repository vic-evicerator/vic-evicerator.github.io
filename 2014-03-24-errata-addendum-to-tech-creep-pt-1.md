Some days it's good to be the pack rat.

After my last post I spent a few hours racking my brains and digging through old paperwork to see exactly when I got the next studio PC (a future post - stay tuned!), and it turns out that I had written about this before, but long enough ago that I'd forgotten I'd written it. Weird, huh? Anyway, back when I was still actively maintaining a website for Rampage I wrote a few articles detailing my past working setups and it turns out I had that first Pavilion PC longer than I thought. It actually survived the move to our new house, but was quickly replaced by a new machine just after we moved. To the previous list of items I listed as recorded on it, I can add:

7. Festering Sore - *Chlorine for the Gene Pool* 
8. Rampage's half of the Megiddo/Rampage split Hellhammer tribute album

As it happens, I upgraded drums not by tech-force, but voluntarily, as I was in search of better sounds all along. The story is told on a now defunct website, but I'm working on bringing it back online, and the sonic evolution of Rampage and Bloody Leg Studios in general is a theme I've been planning to write about here for a while, so the story will come out one way or another.

Note - I really don't want to sound like I'm just patting myself on the back here, but it's weird how in a little under two years I managed to write/record/release eight separate albums and EPs while also turning UHR into something a little more than just a glorified tape-trading outfit.When did the days have that many hours to get things done in? The cynic in me wants to say Global Warming is just increasing friction because of the planet spinning faster and making the days shorter. Scientific literacy tells me otherwise, of course...

Well, at least the return of me to blogging.

After finally getting my studio back to work and getting my band back to work and my label back to work and my websites back to work I figured it was time to get my blog back to work.

Much as I like the layout and style of LiveJournal, that site now resides elsewhere in the world where laws are different, and I prefer not to deal with that kind of shit. Also, everyone and their brother and sister has been using Wordpress for blogging for years, so I figured it's high time I learned to use this shit for myself. So, after an abortive learning attempt at another free host, here we are, at 000webhost, on Wordpress.

I realize I have a lot of shit to get caught up on, which should keep me motivated to keep writing, because if I'm not writing then I'm just wasting time doing some stupid shit in a game, and as fun as that is, that kind of thing is why I was running neck-and-neck with Megiddo to get *The Onslaught* finished. And I don't want to make everyone wait until 2031 for *The Aftermath*, and also there might still be a dozen or two Rampage fans who have been waiting to see what I'll sound like all on my lonesome again.

So, here I am. Yell at me online if I let this get too far behind.

I'll have a longer post later about what's been going on in-depth over the past few months since my last real update. However, since time is short for me at the moment, a quick check-in is in order:

\- Death Beast *The Onslaught* is really happening. I've got final rhythms done for half the songs on the album, some more drum work is in order, vocals are shaping up well (lead vox are done on this half of the album, backing vocals still need some work and we're waiting on one of our backing vocalists to finish up), and we still have solos to worry about.

Moreover, we still have to write half an album. That other half is half-written, in that a lot of ideas and basic arrangements are there, but nothing's set in stone yet. I've been torn between working on new stuff and getting the almost-done half all the way there, and for now I've been choosing 'finish part, then do the rest'. My worry is that it will end up sounding unbalanced - like two half-albums just jammed together. But, when I think about it, that was kinda the case with the last album too.

\- Since I didn't officially announce it, the backing vocals will be bolstered with two guests - Toby from Eyes of Ligeia and Funeral of Gravewurm. This will sound huge, guys. Also, got some great artwork lined up by a noted underground cover artist. More details when the finished product is in hand.

\- I've hinted on FB about getting some Rampage ideas. They're there, but they're still percolating. Remembering the adage about the empty belly of the guy who tried chasing two rabbits, I'm letting the Rampage rabbit lie for now.

\- Publicity - I completed an interview with Les of RetroRocket Reviews zine from Canada. I sent the answered interview back to him a couple of weeks ago, and I think some of the replies might have been a bit, um, irritating or something. If you can track this zine down, check it out. If I ever get the Death Beast website revived I'll post it there as well.

More details later.

I know I sometimes let this blog go, but over a month with NOTHING?

The Midwynter release is doing pretty well, and interest in back ADR catalog items picked up as well, so trades have been crazy. Also, for the 13 days of Halloween the ADR store was running a package deal of pure insanity (13 CDs for $66), which has been keeping me busy too.

Also, I finally got to play with Sonar 6 on my new PC. Me and the boys scratched out a new Death Beast song, "Devastator", which will be on an upcoming compilation. The solos are sloppy as we were too drunk by the end of the session to do them properly, but we'll probably just recut them. The power of this new PC and Sonar 6 is just jaw-dropping. The basic effects are crap, but I am slowly digging up the fx packages I had from my old PC (gotta love DXi!), so that should improve. Also, for Rampage work, I invested in a full licensed version of the DR008 that I used so much with Sonar 2 (but was no longer bundled with Sonar 6), so some Rampage stuff may rear its head before the calendar hits '08.

I know I've said it before, but samples WILL be coming soon. And I'm sure Aerik is hard at work on the Rampage tracks I've given him already...it's only a matter of time.

*(So THAT's when I bought that DR008 software. Too bad not much of what I planned here worked out. Oh well - such was life. And still is, apparently.)*

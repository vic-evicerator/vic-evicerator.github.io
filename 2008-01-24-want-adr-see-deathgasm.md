The sale is final, so we can announce it now.

All of Alpha Draconis Records' leftover stock, both distro items and ADR releases, are now available at Deathgasm Records (http://www.deathgasm.com/). We've known Evan for a while, and he runs an excellent mailorder - without a doubt the best underground metal distro in Georgia. Other labels or distros looking to trade/wholesale ADR items can contact Evan also.

*(This was kind-of a no-brainer. Toby knew the guys at Deathgasm pretty well since he was in a band with one of the guys who worked there, and he mentioned it to them right when we decided to sell it off. Actually, I think the longest bit of wait was because we had to count final inventory to get the right number of discs for the sale offer - so, as usual, it's my fault. :) I think they still have a good deal of that stuff in stock.)*

Finally, some news after too much foot-dragging and too much real life getting in the way of my underground metal star fantasies.

Unsung Heroes Records has finally ended direct distribution. Even the meager amount of direct sales I had was taking too much time when compounded by all of the things going on at home and on the food job, so I worked out a deal with The Basar North America to have them be the exclusive outlet for UHR titles. If you want any of our stuff, go there.

Also, finally, "Our stuff" includes the long-delayed Vrolok "Nocturnal Isolation" demo reissue. It's strictly limited to 100 hand-numbered copies, and the covers are hand-cut xeroxes as a nod to the old days, but the disc itself is pro-duplicated with a full-disc-face printed image and remastered from the original tapes with a couple of bonus tracks. Hopefully you'll agree that the delay was well worth it.

Death Beast is progressing slowly, as some of what has been written before in a drunken stupor proves to not be able to stand up to sober scrutiny. Or was it the other way around? Anyway, Rampage is also making some progress as Aerik works on his home studio vocalizing the music tracks I sent him some time ago. I'm also on the verge of releasing the Rampage "Quid Pro Quo" tribute disc.

Hopefully it won't be six more months to the next update.

*(As fate made it happen, that was the LAST entry to this blog's first incarnation until I resurrected it in 2014. All future history posts will now be culled from the other music blog I ran. And such convoluted duplication is part of why I took so long to get shit done. Keeping up with multiple anything is way more trouble than it's worth. You think you're organized, but you spend too much time organizing that you have no time to work. Organization should be like glass - it does its job, but is just totally transparent - ideally, it should take NO work, but should just LET you work.*

*As for the history here, I either forgot that Vrolok took this long to get released or I was just hyping my last release. After all, I announced in April '08 that it was going to press 'next week'. That's more than a year before this announcement.*

*I also forgot that I was still running UHR on my own. I guess it makes sense, because most places don't like to stock CDRs unless they're pro-duped AND pro-packaged, and while I did the former I never could afford the latter. Besides, there was always something creative and tangible by hand-cutting the covers, making each jewel case by hand, numbering every copy as it got sent out... the digital distribution is superior, and I'm happier that way, but I'd be lying if I said there was NOTHING I missed about the old way.)*

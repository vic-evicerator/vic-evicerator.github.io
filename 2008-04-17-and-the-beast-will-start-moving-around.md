Yuck. THREE months. I could be glib and say I needed the break.

But I'll be honest. I'm a lazy sack of shit. David Lamb, patron saint of the lazy, would be appalled at me.

Anyway, most of the time since I closed down ADR has been spent wasted on video games, reading books I backlogged from bastard-mas, house maintenance (yes, the fucking kitchen leaked again, but this time we think for the last time...). But don't let me bullshit you - those are in descending order of time spent.

However, I DID also manage to get UHR resurrected. Check it out - http://www.mindspring.com/~uhr/ (Dead Link)

We even have a new release - Undimensional's s/t EP. They were a band who sent me a demo completely out of the blue just as ADR wrapped up. It was good - brilliant, really - so I decided to breathe new life into UHR with it.

The Vrolok thing is going to press next week or so, along with some reissues.... AND...

...yep - AERIK contacted me out of the blue again. He's been doing some of his own free-time-roaming, but we're both back now and ready to bring UHR and Rampage back to life. We're working on a compilation of the best of Aerik's recorded work, titled VONTHOLOGY. More details as they arise.

And I guess I must share the details on the upcoming Quid Pro Quo tribute as well, which is coming along nicely.

But I'd best stick to actually GETTING THINGS DONE and then telling you about them, instead of my usual 'here's what we are going to do soon' schtick. I'm done crying wolf.

*(A lot is highlighted here - and not just my burgeoning videogame addiction. It's interesting that I mention 'along with some reissues' - those were the pro-CDR reissues of Rampage "Monolith to an Abandoned Past" and Festering Sore "Chlorine for the Gene Pool". That represented my last gasp at trying to go the pro-CDR route. Having no store, though, forced my hand. With no income, I had no money to press more discs. Ultimately that would lead me to the digital archive on IUMA, so I'm not disappointed.*

*I also find it fitting that those two releases were the first (and last) that I chose to do. I guess I recognized it subconsciously at the time, but after nearly a decade I can say that those are two of the albums I'm most proud of recording. I'm glad they got a proper treatment.*

*Also, you can see Aerik's move to the big city and his diving full-bore into the Von Frankensteins and his day job as a porn mogul sapped the time he had available for our music. I forgot about the Vonthology thing, and even now that I'm reminded of the name I forget the ideas we had about what was going to be on it.*

*Finally we have the Quid Pro Quo tribute, which is now of course dead in the water. It didn't help that I told the board I organized it on to fuck off. The bands were still cool, of course, but I had no easy way to contact them, so now it's just some loose wave files on some archive hard drive someplace. Maybe I'll dig the shit out one day and see what I can do about it...)*

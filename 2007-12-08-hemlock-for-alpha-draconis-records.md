After four years of bringing you the best in underground metal, Alpha Draconis Records is closing its doors for good. For our last six days of existence (December 8-13), we are running a six-six-six package deal - six discs for six bucks each ($36 total for any six items in the store). And hurry, because there IS no 'after' the sale. This is the truest case of SNOOZE AND LOSE you will find.

\---

And I know there are many questions following from the above announcement, from 'why?' to 'what does this mean for UHR?' - and there WILL be answers. Soon. So please be patient and satiate your curiosity by sublimating it into a desire for more new music instead (wink wink nudge nudge). All will be made clear here, eventually...

*(I knew we made this decision fast, but looking at the posting history I'm still surprised at how fast it was - there was no inkling of it in the previous post from Nov. 1 2007. I still pretty much remember the day it happened, but that's a story best left for its own post.*

*And I promise I'll get to all of these posts I've been promising in these historical comments. Above all, I'm a talker, and all of this reposting and commenting has whetted my appetite for writing again.)*

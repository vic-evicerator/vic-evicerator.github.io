<P>
This demo compilation managed to serve as double-duty for me on a personal level. First, ever since the
album came out I had fans asking for demos, especially to hear the cover versions that we had done on
the first demo and to hear any of the hanging-on Ramrod demo tracks. Second, in 2007 the plan I had to
slowly release new Rampage material that Aerik was going to record vocals for over the years 2006-2008 
or do was not coming to fruition, and I wanted to keep some material coming out on UHR. Working with
other bands like Demontage and Black Torment was good, but I wanted my own music to come out as well.
I finally put two and two together, dug into my vault, and here is the result.
</P>
<P>I'm still obviously not happy with my vocals on here, but then again they were never intended to 
be final vocals anyway, and I figure even bad vocals are better than no vocals for demo releases like
this. Those tracks are pretty key, though, in showing the growth of sound between the <I>Apocalypse Metal</I>
demo and the final album - the move from big, slick drums and buzzy black-metal-styled guitars to a
more cohesive, thrash-oriented sound is pretty obvious when these tracks are played alongside the
earlier demo tracks.</P>
<P> The Ramrod tracks, though, are the real cream of the crop here. While I'm totally happy with
the direction the band has gone with vocals now, I had wanted to work with Ramrod for years, and I
do feel some regret that this handful of tracks is all we really collaborated on together. Still,
something is better than nothing.</P>

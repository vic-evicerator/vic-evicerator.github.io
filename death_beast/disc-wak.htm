<H3>Vic's Thoughts on <I>The Wakening</I></H3>

<DIV width=75%> <!-- Width DIV START -->
<P>
The recording of <I>The Wakening</I> flowed directly from the recording of the demo. I was
still writing the newer songs like "Psychosis/Invoking Villainy" and "Enslaved Cadavers" while
at the same time refining the guitar and bass sounds and laying down better-sounding and
better-produced audio tracks. I was happier with the more professional sound that we had
on this one compared to the earlier demo songs.
</P>
<P>As you may have heard from the songs or the tales surrounding the various pieces of
the <I>Prophecies of Doom</I> demo compilation, we were also planning on slotting in 
Ramrod's vocals here, but when that didn't work out we redid rehearsal vocals with me
while hunting for the new vocalist, Notorius. When he joined we had still another new song,
"Here Comes the War" thanks to Ramrod and Aerik, and we didn't want the new vocals to go
over tracks that were one to two years old, so in early 2005 we pretty much rerecorded the
entire album with all-new takes, building off of the "Here Comes the War" basic tracks
that were easily the best-sounding 'demos' that we had.</P>
<P>The final takes were all done through Spring of 2005, maybe bleeding over into early summer,
but going back now I seem to remember it still being a few months between when we handed
over the master and when it was released in September of 2005. I was still in a fast-and-furious
'record' mode, though, because I managed to get a lot of Rampage stuff done over the last half 
of 2005 and into early 2006, even if not much of it has made its way into the light of day
yet. But, that's another band and another issue for another day.</P>
<P>As for <I>The Wakening</I> itself, I'm still really happy with it. If there are two
minor gripes with it, they are such: first, I wish I hadn't poured so much reverb on top
of the delay on the lead vocals - it still sounds too cavernous for my current tastes, like
I'd listened to too much early 2000s Norse Black Metal - and I wish I'd remembered to 
tell Tormentor to put that big drum fill just before the third verse on "Here Comes
the War". He did it the way I wanted on the live album, and I don't know why I didn't 
have him fix it up on the studio track. I think I may have just been impatient to get
the damn album finished at that time. Live and learn, I guess.</P>

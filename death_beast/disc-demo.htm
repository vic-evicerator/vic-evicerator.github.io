<P>
Despite what some archivists 'think', this is a real demo. It just didn't start out that way.
</P>
<P>
The start of the band was really quick, with Dementor sending me lyrics for these four songs
pretty much immediately after we agreed to work on a band together, and then with Axe agreeing
to work with me on the music pretty much at the same time. While working on recording these I 
talked with Dementor a few times about possible cover songs, and unable to choose we ended up
doing them all. Then, while doing those cover songs, Dementor sent me lyrics for a couple of
other new songs (Enslaved Cadavers, Invoking Villainy).</P>
<P>
Also quick was the interest from Barbarian Wrath. I had just finished the recording and mixing
of these songs and was about to start on the two newest ones when Hartmuth asked for a demo
of this. We had already conceived of this being a full album, but after an MP3 of the song "Apocalypse
Metal" he demanded a CDR of everything done so far. I burned that, and to do the cover I just fired
up "CaseLinr" (some freeware I got for quick jewelcase liners like you see above) and typed it up
in an Old-English style font. We didn't even have a logo yet!
</P>
<P>
Things fell apart for that lineup of the band not too long after, unfortunately. Dementor quit 
a few months later when Skelator's recording PC blew up, right after I started rerecording music
to get better sounds matching the instrumental tracks of the newer songs I was working on. At that
point we were considering pressing forward, finishing the music and working on finding a new vocalist,
and so finishing the demo for a proper release didn't seem as worth it as aiming for the full album.
Still, a few copies of this were given to trusted friends, and then of course we packaged it
on the <I>Prophecies of Doom</I> demo compilation. So, ultimately, this means that this might
be one of the most limited releases ever made - four or five hand-made copies? CULT!

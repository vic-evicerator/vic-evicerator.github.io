APOCALYPSE METAL
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

Raging armies of madmen 
Storm the gates of the heavens
The holy die by metal
Hear the voices of demons

Armageddon is descending
Thy torment's never ending
At last the prophecy came true
Storms of Metal Vengeance
APOCALYPSE METAL

With a swing of the axe severed is god's head
And the cloven hoof is the sign
As monarch, forever, Darkness reigns
The iron hammer smashes the cross
All hope for humanity is eternally lost

The four horsemen draw their swords
Death War Famine Pestilence
Ride upon the beasts of violence
In the fateful abyss
APOCALYPSE METAL

Spread the legs of the nun
Bang your head until exhaustion
Drink the blood of the minister
Vomit on jehovah's altars
Metal has triumphed, finally
Total death to eternity - DIE!

Solo - Axe

ENSLAVED CADAVERS
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist and Notorius Butcherus

Thousands of rotting coffins lay empty
Under thousands of tombstones
Paranormal morbidity stirs as
Corpses are reborn to serve

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers

solo - Axe

(missing four lines of lyrics here)
No mortal shall remain alive
Nightmares haunt those who breathe
No escape no matter if you live or die
Blood curdling terror burns deep

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers

solo - Axe

Join us...

THUNDER OF ARMAGEDDON
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

Hear the roar, the sounds of war
Hear the thunder of Apocalypse
See the sky where the demons fly
In the darkness of the midnight eclipse

Thunder of Armageddon
Crashing in the black sky
Thunder of Armageddon
This is the end of all time

Blades they clash, bloody from the smash
Kill and Triumph are the only commands
The Armies of Hell are under a spell
Your life will no longer exist

Thunder of Armageddon
Crashing in the black sky
Thunder of Armageddon
This is the end of all time

See the black silhouette in the shape of horns
See the black wings of Lucifer
The devilish legions arise
Hear the end of time
Hear the Thunder of Apocalypse

Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming NOW!!!

Hear the roar, the sounds of war
Hear the thunder of Apocalypse
See the sky where the demons fly
In the darkness of the midnight eclipse

Solo - Axe

BLOOD OF DIONYSUS
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

Blood of Dionysus, the poison of choice
Blood of Dionysus, to fuck up my head
Blood of Dionysus, the poison of choice
Blood of Dionysus, I wish I was dead

I choose to swallow this poison
Fuck up my head 'til perversion
Blood of Dionysus inside this chalice
Drink unto the gods of self-malice

Drink til you die!

solo - Axe

Get all fucked up, destroy my brain
To welcome death and forget the pain
Hatred burns deep inside
Misanthropy, I hate this life!

Blood of Dionysus, yeah...

solo - Axe

Blood of Dionysus, it's a curse to live

HERE COMES THE WAR
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Aerik Von

Feel the heat, the burning streets as bullets rape the air
The bombs will fly and men will die and nobody will care
But empty heads obsessed with death just so afraid to die
A protest here – just built on fear and tears the cowards cry
But in the trench or on the bench the others hide from heroes ends
Insurgents rise to spite the lives of a reign come to an end
Roadside bombs like horrid songs explode with living hell
The war still lost, but keeps the costs of lives where soldiers fell

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war

The flag is torn, weakened and worn being burned by those we "saved"
The soilders grind against the tide in lands that rest untamed
In the name of God, the killing dog who spurs them to attack
From friends to foes to silent death, the blade against the back
From desert sands, by foreign hands, the gates of hell tear free
Chemical war, the silent whore, may spread it's misery
We took the throne but now lay prone for the God and his mad slaves
The war won't end till all lay dead and rot in nameless graves

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war

Solos - Vic, Axe, Vic, harmony, Vic, Axe, Vic, Axe

The tanks are burned, and overturned, the cities smoke and ash
To save the mind, the killing kind, false peace the aftermath
Our bitter mold, a social gold, forced down upon the tribe
A despot king to justice bring but we failed to save the lives
And now we're here, still torn by fear, fighting street to street
The war still hot, the "peace" that's not, but death you get to keep
The fire ceased – so soon released, the war will not subside
When soilders trained take on the rage it's the fate of man to die

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war

INVOKING VILLAINY 
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

Whispers turn to screams in the black mass
Orgies of fiends in the black mass
Sacrifice for sin in the black mass
Nothing is forbidden in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Black Mass Insanity

Scourging virgins in the black mass
Raping purity in the black mass
Only sinners survive the black mass
All others die in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Satanic Insanity

solo - Vic

In the Black Mass
In the Black Mass

EVERY CHURCH SHALL BURN
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist and Notorius Butcherus

They call me a blasphemer, call me a lecher
I call 'em fools, mindless sheep, worthless beggars
I shall indulge in every sin, rebel until I die
I shall reject their book of lies
It's hypocritical content is only good for one act
Take your holy bible and wipe your shit-soaked ass

I blaspheme the holy chapel
Make the holy nuns suck my dick
Perversion of the holy 'virgin'
Inversion of the crucifix
Sadistic, scourging thy wife brings me pleasure
Psychopathic, I laugh as I slit the priest's throat
I'll thrust the Devil's unholy trident 
Up holy mother mary's cunt

So the idiots call me sick
Say I should be imprisoned
When the time comes to kill
You shall all know my reasons
The bastards are stupid, they drive me insane
One day they shall feel the edge of my blade

solos - Vic, Axe, Vic, Axe

I blaspheme the holy chapel
Make the nuns suck my dick
Perversion of the Holy Virgin
Inversion of the Crucifix
Sadistic, scourging thy wife brings me pleasure
Psychopathic, I laugh as I slit the priest's throat
I'll thrust the Devil's unholy trident 
Up the Mother Mary's cunt

As the blasphemy is invoked
As the holy die
As the 'virgin's' hymen is torn
As the Antichrist is born
As the end of time dawns
Every church shall burn

Every church shall burn

DEATH BEAST
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

There is no time to prepare...

Solo - Vic

Unholy disease usurps the land
The evil beast destroys all men
Damnation rose from the depths of Hell
Pestilence upon the world befell
Disease a plague of incredible agony
Man shall suffer, writhe in pain, eternally

Destroyed by the Death Beast
With black wings of doom and horns for impalement
Destroyed by the Death Beast
How he soars and maims, beast of the plague

Killed by the Death Beast, slaughtered for fun
Damned by the Plague Beast, Evil has won
Murdered by the Death Beast, Violence is King
Tortured by the Plague Beast, eternally

Destroyed by the Death Beast
How he soars and maims, beast of the plague
Destroyed by the Death Beast
With black wings of doom and horns for impalement

The Death Beast usurps the land...
The pestilence destroys all men...
Evil rose from the crypts of hell
Damnation upon this world befell
The last of the plagues, the final Black Death
Now mankind shall feel Ahriman's wrath...

solo - Axe

The Death Beast
The Hell Beast
The Death Beast
The Plague Beast

AGENT OF THE REAPER
Music - Axecutioner
Lyrics - Irönfist

They call me Dementor, The Destroyer, The Demon
They call me a killer, Agent of the Reaper
For when you least expect it early in your life
A shadowy figure stalks you, and you're murdered by my knife
Before the Reaper takes you if he thinks you should die instantly
He raises up his scepter, and to slay, he summons me

Agent of the Reaper - Executioner of the Worthless
Agent of the Reaper - Bringer of Diabolical murder
Agent of the Reaper - Slayer of youthful mortals
Agent of the Reaper - I am your destroyer!

solo - Axe

In the shadows I lurk
In the dead of night
When you hear my footsteps
You shall die of fright
And when you feel me, getting near
Nothing shall save you, as you drown in fear
And then I will strike, send you down to hell
Slit your jugular vein, at Death's Command

Agent of the Reaper

solo - Axe

They call me Dementor, The Destroyer, The Demon
They call me a killer, Agent of the Reaper
For when you least expect it early in your life
A shadowy figure stalks you, and you're murdered by my knife
Before the Reaper takes you if he thinks you should die instantly
He raises up his scepter, and to slay, he summons me

Agent of the Reaper - Executioner of the Worthless
Agent of the Reaper - Bringer of Diabolical murder
Agent of the Reaper - Slayer of youthful mortals
Agent of the Reaper - I am your destroyer!

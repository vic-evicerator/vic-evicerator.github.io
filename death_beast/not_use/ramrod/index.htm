 <LI><B>THE WAKENING</B> - this is supposed to be a 'noise and screams from the abyss' intro
 along the lines of the intro to Hell Awaits or the first Sacrifice album.  I just put that down
 to have something for reference.  I plan on mixing in more weird delay/reverse effects on the
 guitars, and really messing with any screams in the mix (reverse, reverse reverb, odd
 panning, etc.).  If you want to add any guitar tracks to this go for it.  Anything to make
 it more hellish.</LI>
 <LI><B>APOCALYPSE METAL</B> - You've already heard this, of course.  No real surprises
 there...</LI>
 <LI><B>ENSLAVED CADAVERS</B> - two verses and two choruses - the choruses are of course the
 lines that end with "Enslaved Cadavers", and I guess you can tell which riff is supposed to 
 be the chorus riff.  The whole "Join Us..." thing should be over that slow outro riff that
 will fade when it's done.  I figure if you want to you can do the little between-verse solo
 if you want and any sort of atmospheric/noise lead guitar effects that would help over the
 outro.</LI>
 <LI><B>DEATH BEAST</B> - again, you've heard this one before with the vox done so there
 are no real surprises there.  I originally wrote the intro to have some lyrics over it, which
 is why the lead guitar starts up then stops abruptly over that triplet march riff, since that's where
 the lyrics were supposed to go.  Now that it's empty, I like the idea of having the little lead guitar intro
 lead into a slowish, kinda melodic solo that goes up until the riff changes.  You can have this
 solo if you want - but if you can, kinda keep the start of it I have - it's easy, and I can tab
 it for you if you want.</LI>
 <LI><B>BLOOD OF DIONYSUS</B> - no surprises here.  you can just ad-lib whatever you want under the bluesy solo.
 I really like all the solos I did on this one, but I'm thinking the blues 12-bar bit would be perfect for
 one of your solos, maybe even with the wah.  If you want to give this a try let me know.</LI>
 <LI><B>NEW SONG</B> - I forgot the title you told me for this.  You'll be writing lyrics, so
 you know how they fit best.  The solos are in three parts, A-B-A, with a harmony part for what would
 be the fourth one.  After I recorded this, I thought that maybe that 'chorus' that happens
 right after the solo should have alternating 'stabs' between the two guitars - like the ringing
 chords go, then when the chugging goes have a little two-bar fill, and they alternate A-B-A-B.
 (Think of the leads in the last chorus of the song "Exodus").  You can choose either A or B for
 either solo section.
 </LI>
 <LI><B>PSYCHOSIS/INVOKING VILLAINY</B> - Psychosis is the intro/clean part and heavy
 section up until the speed kicks in.  I've pretty much written solos for both songs that I'd
 like to keep, but I may ask you to take one later if I can't get it recorded properly.</LI>
 <LI><B>THUNDER OF ARMAGEDDON</B> - There won't be any surprises on this one, except that
 I may add another rhythm under the harmonies just before the final solo.</LI>
 <LI><B>EVERY CHURCH SHALL BURN</B> - The verses seem to be odd lengths (six bars/repeats) but
 they fit the lyrics in a weird way.  The lyrics themselves had a weird rhythm, but I wrote it
 in a way that fits together fairly well - I can record you a scratch of it if you can't pick up
 what I had in mind or work out something that works.  The solos are alternating again, A-B-A-B, so
 you can pick whichever set you want.  The fade was going to be with increasingly intricate
 drumbeats/fills, but if you have any lyrical things or guitar noise that would work that'll be
 cool too. </LI>
 <LI><B>AGENT OF THE REAPER</B> - I think this one is pretty straightforward.  I'll keep the solo
 and fills in this one.  The lyrics have six lines for the verse, but he manages to fit them
 into four.  I have a badly-unsynced-track of this where the drums are out of time with the
 guitars, but it does have the vocals in it so you can hear what the original idea was.
 When I dig it up I'll post it here.</LI>

APOCALYPSE METAL

Raging armies of madmen 
Storm the gates of the heavens
The Holy die by metal
Hear the voices of demons

Armageddon is descending
Thy Torment is never ending
At last the prophecy came true
Storms of Metal Vengeance - APOCALYPSE METAL!

With a swing of the axe severed is god's head
And the cloven hoof is the sign
As monarch, forever, Darkness reigns
The iron hammer smashes the cross
All hope for humanity is eternally lost

The four horsemen draw their swords
Death War Famine Pestilence
Ride upon the beasts of violence
In the fateful abyss - APOCALYPSE METAL

Spread the legs of the nun
Bang your head until exhaustion
Drink the blood of the minister
Vomit on Jehovah's Altars
Metal has triumphed, finally
Total death to eternity - DIE!

solo


THUNDER OF ARMAGEDDON

Hear the roar, the sounds of war
Hear the thunder of Apocalypse
See the sky where the demons fly
In the darkness of the midnight eclipse

Thunder of Armageddon
Crashing in the black sky
Thunder of Armageddon
This is the end of all time

Blades they clash, bloody from the smash
Kill and Triumph are the only commands
For the Army of Hell, Zombies under a spell
Death down to earth descends

Thunder of Armageddon
Crashing in the black sky
Thunder of Armageddon
This is the end of all time

See the black silhouette in the shape of horns
See the black wings of Lucifer
See the devilish legions arise
Hear the end of time, hear the Thunder of Apocalypse

Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming
Armageddon is coming NOW!!!

Hear the roar, the sounds of war
Hear the thunder of Apocalypse
See the sky where the demons fly
In the darkness of the midnight eclipse

Solo


BLOOD OF DIONYSUS

Blood of Dionysus, the poison of choice
Blood of Dionysus, to fuck up my head
Blood of Dionysus, the poison of choice
Blood of Dionysus, I wish I was dead

I choose to swallow this poison
Fuck up my head 'til perversion
Blood of Dionysus inside this chalice
Drink to the gods of self-malice

Drink til you die!

solo

Get all fucked up, destroy my brain
To welcome death and forget the pain
Hatred burns deep inside
Misanthropy, I hate this life!

Blood of Dionysus, yeah...

blues solo (w/ ad-lib)

Blood of Dionysus
Blood of Dionysus
Blood of Dionysus
Blood of Dionysus, it's a curse to live


DEATH BEAST

There is no time to prepare...

Unholy disease usurps the land
The evil beast destroys all men
Damnation rose from the depths of Hell
Pestilence upon the world befell
Disease a plague of incredible agony
Man shall suffer, writhe in pain, eternally

Destroyed by the Death Beast
With black wings of doom and horns for impalement
Destroyed by the Death Beast
How he soars and maims, beast of the plague

Killed by the Death Beast, slaughtered for fun
Damned by the Plague Beast, Evil has won
Murdered by the Death Beast, Violence is King
Tortured by the Plague Beast, eternally

Destroyed by the Death Beast
How he soars and maims, beast of the plague
Destroyed by the Death Beast
With black wings of doom and horns for impalement

The Death Beast usurps the land...
The pestilence destroys all men...
Evil rose from the crypts of hell
Damnation upon this world befell
The last of the plagues, the final Black Death
Now mankind shall feel Ahriman's wrath...

EVERY CHURCH SHALL BURN

They call me a blasphemer, call me a lecher
I clal 'em fools, mindless sheep, worthless beggars
I shall indulge in every sin, rebel until I die
I shall reject their book of lies
It's hypocritical content is only good for one act
Take your holy bible and wipe your shit-soaked ass

I blaspheme the holy chapel
Make the nuns suck my dick
Perversion of the Holy Virgin
Inversion of the Crucifix
Sadistic, scourging thy wife brings me pleasure
Psychopathic, I laugh as I slit the priest's throat
I'll thrust the Devil's unholy trident 
Up the Mother Mary's cunt

So the idiots call me sick
Say I should be imprisoned
When the time comes to kill
You shall all know my reasons
The bastards are stupid, they drive me insane
One day they shall feel the edge of my blade

I blaspheme the holy chapel
Make the nuns suck my dick
Perversion of the Holy Virgin
Inversion of the Crucifix
Sadistic, scourging thy wife brings me pleasure
Psychopathic, I laugh as I slit the priest's throat
I'll thrust the Devil's unholy trident 
Up the Mother Mary's cunt

As the Virgin's Hymen is torn
As the Antichrist is born
As the end of time dawns
Every church shall burn


ENSLAVED CADAVERS

Thousands of rotting coffins lay empty
Under thousands of tombstones
Paranormal morbidity stirs as
Corpses are reborn to serve

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master…
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers…

No mortal shall remain alive
Nightmares haunt those who breathe
No escape no matter if you live or die
Blood curdling terror burns deep

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master…
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers…

Join us… Join us...
Join us… Join us…
Join us… Join us…

INVOKING VILLAINY 

Whispers turn to screams in the black mass
Orgies of fiends in the black mass
Sacrifice for sin in the black mass
Nothing is forbidden in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Black Mass Insanity

Scourging virgins in the black mass
Raping purity in the black mass
Only sinners survive the black mass
All others die in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Satanic Insanity

...the Black Mass!

=============

AGENT of the REAPER

They call me Dementor, The Destroyer, The Demon
They call me a killer, Agent of the Reaper
For when you least expect it early in your life
A shadowy figure stalks you, and you're murdered by my knife
Before the Reaper takes you if he thinks you should die instantly
He raises up his scepter, and to slay, he summons me

Agent of the Reaper
Executioner of the Worthless
Agent of the Reaper
Bringer of Diabolical murder
Agent of the Reaper
Slayer of youthful mortals
Agent of the Reaper
I am your destroyer!

Mid-song bridge:
In the shadows I lurk
In the dead of night
When you hear my footsteps
You shall die of fright
And when you feel me, getting near
Nothing shall save you, as you drown in fear
And then I will strike, send you down to hell
Slit your jugular vein, at Death's Command

(repeat verse, chorus)

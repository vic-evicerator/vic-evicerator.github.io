ENSLAVED CADAVERS

Thousands of rotting coffins lay empty
Under thousands of tombstones
Paranormal morbidity stirs as
Corpses are reborn to serve

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master…
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers…

No mortal shall remain alive
Nightmares haunt those who breathe
No escape no matter if you live or die
Blood curdling terror burns deep

Undead minions of darkness
Fight for their master…
An army of corpses
Enslaved cadavers…

Join us… Join us...
Join us… Join us…
Join us… Join us…

INVOKING VILLAINY 

Whispers turn to screams in the black mass
Orgies of fiends in the black mass
Sacrifice for sin in the black mass
Nothing is forbidden in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Black Mass Insanity

Scourging virgins in the black mass
Raping purity in the black mass
Only sinners survive the black mass
All others die in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Satanic Insanity

...the Black Mass!

AGENT of the REAPER

They call me Dementor, The Destroyer, The Demon
They call me a killer, Agent of the Reaper
For when you least expect it early in your life
A shadowy figure stalks you, and you're murdered by my knife
Before the Reaper takes you if he thinks you should die instantly
He raises up his scepter, and to slay, he summons me

Agent of the Reaper
Executioner of the Worthless
Agent of the Reaper
Bringer of Diabolical murder
Agent of the Reaper
Slayer of youthful mortals
Agent of the Reaper
I am your destroyer!

Mid-song bridge:
In hte shadows I lurk
In the dead of night
When you hear my footsteps
You shall die of fright
And when you feel me, getting near
Nothing shall save you, as you drown in fear
And then I will strike, send you down to hell
Slit your jugular vein, at Death's Command

(repeat verse, chorus)

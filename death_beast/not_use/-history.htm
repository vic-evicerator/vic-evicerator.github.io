<P>It started with <I>New World Blasphemy</I>.</P>

<P>In early 2001 Vic of Rampage was organizing a black metal split release
for Unsung Heroes Records that featured Rampage, Cross Sodomy, and Song of
Melkor.  In the course of that, Vic and Dementor decided to form some kind
of new project with Dementor handling lyrics and vocals and Vic handling
the music.  When Vic saw the lyrics, the unremitting violent blasphemy 
gave him the same feelings as some of the great death/thrash classics of
the past and inspired him to pitch the idea of this band being a real thrash
band - the kind that had been extinct for 15 years ever since political
awareness, moralistic bullshit, and socialist whining devolved one of the most
violent forms of music to pathetically laughable 'CNN metal'.
</P>
<P>
Vic and Dementor created the band name DEATH BEAST and took the names Evicerator 
and Ironfist.  Evicerator began recruiting members and quickly found fellow guitarist
Axecutioner.  Evicerator and Axecutioner started writing, and within a couple of months
four songs and a couple of covers were somewhat finished.  Ironfist completed
some vocals, and a few solos were still to be done, when Black Goat of BARBARIAN WRATH
became aware of the band.  He demanded mp3s, so Vic sent him the mostly-but-not-totally
finished tracks as a demo, and Black Goat immediately signed the band.

<P>
Despite not having a full lineup, the band began fleshing out the demo to full-album
length, finishing the unfinished tracks and writing more new ones.  By early 2002
a primitive version of <I>The Wakening</I> was completed musically and sent to
Ironfist for completion of vocals.  Axecutioner had also found a drummer, Black Tormentor,
and auditions had turned up a somewhat passable bassist.  The band managed to play a couple of shows
over the summer of 2002, but then circumstances started conspiring against the band...

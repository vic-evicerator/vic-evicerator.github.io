Since my last post I've finally finished migrating all of my separate musical blogs to this spot. That leaves just a couple of housecleaning details to fix on other sites, but for all practical purposes this is now a fully armed and operational music blog.

I started migrating here on July 19 and I finished today, September 21, a total of 64 days. I moved a total of 188 blog posts from two separate old blogs, spanning the time frame from October 2004 through May 2014. Thousands of words easily have been spilled from my fingertips, covering things from history to news to rantings and board drama and bullshit, from the death of friends to the death of computers to the death of pseudonyms, from songwriting to lyrics to why and how I mixed or EQed things. I even managed to remember a lot of things I thought I forgot, and even managed to remember some things I really did forget. Good thing this need to remember my past has always been with me, or I'd be much sadder about what's been lost. Again, Father Elijah was right - the hard part is letting go.

Anyway, this was just one prong of many in trying to move myself from a vegetative videogame and beer consumer back to a productive musician. Because, while a lot of things have changed, one thing hasn't - music is still what speaks to me most, particularly music of the dark, gruesome kind, and it's still something I want to make. While I didn't blog during my most productive period, most of this blog was made right in its wake, when I was still coming to terms with being so productive musically, while still being stimulated by music I was hearing and sharing and selling. Reviewing this much history in such a short time from so long ago has been enlightening - while I thought I was just capturing the daily grind, the nuts-n-bolts of this song or that release, I realize that I did manage to capture a glimpse here and there of my musical demiurge. He's asleep, and fat and lazy from too much sitting around, but I have verbal pictures of him in his prime. He looked damn good, and I think he can get into somewhat similar shape again if I push him.

Now it's time to put his ass on the treadmill. Wish me luck.

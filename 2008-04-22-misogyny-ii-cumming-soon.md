As in the music has been recorded some time ago, and vocal studio time is booked. This bitch will be done quite soon.

And, just to tease, the instrumental intro to the EP, "GHB", has been put online at the Rampage Myspace page - http://www.myspace.com/rampage (Dead Link)

Enjoy, and await the rest.

*(If Aerik really got as far as I assumed he did every time he told me "dude, I've almost got it done", then there are probably half a dozen finished versions of this EP on various recording tapes and PCs scattered around Brooklyn. This time I thought it was imminent, because he's the one who managed that Rampage Myspace page and he's the one who posted GHB, which is the instrumental opener to the EP.*

*I REALLY must finish that off someday, but it'll have to be with some newer lyrics. And a new title.)*

In all the hubbub, I can't believe I almost forgot this.

Ujval Singh Sidhu-Brar of [The Metal Crypt](http://www.metalcrypt.com/) has just posted an extensive interview with me about, well, pretty much every musical thing I've got my finger in. He even dug deep, asking me about history like my Early Warning and Skiptoe days, my favorite band Disjecta Membra (the greatest band you've never heard), and even digging up stuff like the Kaoteon affair. He even gets to the hardhitting questions about songwriting, major versus minor labels, and what's wrong with NSBM.

Anyway, [go check it out](http://metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=199).

*(This interview was a ton of fun, and I'm still happy with almost everything I said in it and can stand behind it 100% even now, seven years later. Good on ya, Cluedo.)*

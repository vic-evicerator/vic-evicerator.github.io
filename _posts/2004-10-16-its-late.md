Damn, every time I want to write in here it's too late to put anything coherent together.

Ah well.

Listen to Rampage here: <http://www.audiostreet.net/thetruerampage/>

_(Again, weird that I would put so little here. Though I guess the link to Audiostreet was relevant. It was one of many music-sharing sites that sprang up in the wake of the demise of mp3.com, and it had some nice social features from what I remember._

_However, audiostreet is now dead as well. It redirects to some shit like 561media, a company that builds websites. It's like driving through your old neighborhood, where you lived and played with your friends, and finding that they paved the whole thing over for a new Wally World.)_

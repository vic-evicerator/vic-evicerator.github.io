No, not meme-tagging. I finally finished tagging all of the entries in this journal. Now you can search through the blog for all my posts about band news, about a specific album, all my lyrics posts, etc. The full list of tags is below:

- band 
- history 
- band news 
- bellum aeternum 
- bellum infinitum 
- crimson frost 
- essays 
- label 
- news 
- misogyny 
- misogyny 2 
- monolith 
- song lyrics 
- this end up

(Yes, it forces them all to lower case. Blech.)

Anyway, go have fun and re-learn something you thought you forgot about us.

*(This needs some revisions, but it's still nice to see it laid out like this. Interesting, also, that a historical fix was faster back then. This took from 6/26 to 6/29, while these repostings have been going on now for about two months. In the notes on my last post I said it was gratifying to see I'm still in the same headspace. But it turns to chagrin when I see that the distractors are still sadly the same - but more time-consuming.)*

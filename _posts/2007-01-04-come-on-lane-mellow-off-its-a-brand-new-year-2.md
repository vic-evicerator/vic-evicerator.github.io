I figure since I missed my xmas-time post here I might as well quote from one of my favorite holiday movies. In fact, we've moved past that holiday right to the next one, the turning of the year - that annual time when everyone gets around to making promises they don't intend to keep.

And I guess I shall be no different. But at least I'll make mine public so yall can berate me for not holding up my end of the bargain.

- I WILL finish the next Death Beast album before half this year is out. I'm tired of having this hang over me, so I will make time for it, actively. I've also committed to a split with a new band, Iron Witch, so that may end up being the teaster/appetizer that kicks me back into music gear.

- I WILL finish the mixing/mastering of *Bellum Aeternum* post-haste. I need the hard-drive space for the above. I can't give an estimate on this one though - live play-back stutters for some reason I can't figure out, though exporting mixes come out fine, so I'll have to mix for every little mix tweak; a sure, but VERY SLOW, process.

- I WILL begin working on both Dauder Sofa AND *Letters From Hell*. I will have at least one song for each done by the end of February.

- I WILL get more stuff released on UHR. Demontage and Black Torment are doing about as well as I expected, and now the money is in place so I can proceed with my old plan of dribbling out the backlog of releases I built up while waiting for Michael to get here.

- I WILL get the ADR/UHR newsletter started. I tried this in the fading months of '06, but it got nowhere because nobody else offered to contribute (or if they did, they didn't actually do it. Halfway or more my fault, since I suck at the follow-through - something else I WILL fix...). So, look for invitations to join up in a few weeks, and you people on UHR and ADR look out for solicitations for content.

- and, for fun and practice, I WILL record a couple of Dire Straits covers. (Hey, some of these ol' resolution things can be fun too, right?)

And so there you have it folks. My virtual nuts are on the anvil, you all have virtual sledgehammers, so feel free to virtually blast away if I start slipping. Now I gotta get to work.

*(These 'accountability' posts never worked out as well as I'd hoped, but I am glad I have them, because they did give nutshell recounts of what I DID manage to finish in the immediate past and they give a window into what I cared about doing at the time. Or at least what I said I cared about doing. Honestly, though, the latter may more apply to today, but back then I was eaten up with increasing job and family responsibilities. Now that I know, though, I really have no excuses.)*

Why blog if I never put anything in? I dunno.

What makes it worse is that sometimes I think these kinds of things are too self-important. Who gives a fuck what's happening with my life? People I know, but aren't I already in contact with them? Wouldn't they already know all this? So I put it on the web to.... do what? tell people I DON'T know what I'm doing?

Seems pretty silly.

But, that's the curse of the artist, and of those of us who aspire to it. Which is kindof the whole point. By the same token, who cares about my music? Well, I already have the answer to that - quite a few people. So, maybe they'd be interested in what goes on behind it all - WHY do I create, and HOW does it happen? Where do those little grains of sand come from, and what's the process by which I wrap on the layers and create the pearl?

Sometimes, quite often in fact, I wonder that same thing myself - and I do it all the time. Weird, huh?

Well, bear with me, and maybe we can figure it out together.

If you haven't seen it already, go to my main band's webpage, http://thetruerampage.cjb.net/ (now a dead link - [go here instead](http://vic-evicerator.github.io/rampage/) ) When you get to the menu, go to "Rampage Speaks" and you can see three blog-type articles I've written about my guitars, my studio, and my other gear. That's sort of the background for what I've been using to make all this stuff. In future posts here I'll talk about specific songs or albums - if you have any preferences for me to discuss, let me know.

_(I still hadn't got into the idea about what blogging is, how the best blogs have, among many other things, constant updates. Still, I was on my way, and this one at least has more than two paragraphs._

_Also, another defunct URL hanging out there like an old snapshot. CJB.net was a free URL-redirect service that most people were using - it wrapped an ad around your site or gave you an interstitial. I think it changed over time. The Rampage website was hosted on my personal domain from my ISP, which at the time was Mindspring.com. It got bought out by Earthlink, but everyone who had mindspring kept their email addresses and domains. It was a badge of honor, because Earthlink's service was only so-so but at the time Mindspring was tops in customer service surveys. But, sadly, the guy decided to cash out and the company went to the shitter._

_Did I mention I'm not on Earthlink anymore either?)_

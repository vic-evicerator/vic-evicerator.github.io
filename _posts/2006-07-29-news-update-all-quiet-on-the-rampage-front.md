Just to let you all know that I AM staying current, but that there just isn't much going on.

I still haven't got my PC totally rebuilt, so I haven't been able to see if I can salvage the earlier-recorded _Bellum_ sessions. I just bought a much-needed DVD burner for that PC, so I have to open it up soon anyway, thus I will have the perfect 'excuse' to get this done soon.

Not that it matters too much - Aerik has told me that nothing new will come out from his end of things until October.

Still, he's sitting on three things right now, with a fourth probably in his hands by then.

I'm still playing with my strat, learning old Dire Straits licks and songs, and just getting used to a different sound and style of playing. This will come to fruition when I start writing the Dauder Sofa material in earnest.

And, don't worry, I haven't forgotten about Death Beast or *Letters from Hell*...

But, for now, all is quiet on the Rampage front.

***

*"Dauder Sofa". "Letters From Hell". So many dead-ends of roads that could have gone places. Maybe someday...*

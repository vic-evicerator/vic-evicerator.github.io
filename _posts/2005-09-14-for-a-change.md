For a change, vacation was disaster-free. A good time was had by all, we stayed as long as we planned, and our house didn't leak. Very relaxing.

Until Monday morning when I saw the pile of work that had hit my work-email inbox... but I guess that's what they call job security.

The big list of things a couple of posts down is still hanging over me like a sword of damocles, but progress is being made on all fronts - and a few new developments that need integration into the already-mounting pile of stuff to do. What is 'job security' at work is just a 'pain in the ass' at home. Still, as the french say, 'such is life'. (Of course, they had to rip off Robbie Neville to do it...)

I WILL say this much, at least, right now... it seems I'll STILL be a distributor for Barbarian Wrath, in some capacity. But the details will have to wait until I make a molehill out of this mountain of work in front of me...

*(Again, those threads from other areas are poking through, but I also see the note regarding distributing Barbarian Wrath titles. When looking at broad strokes you miss details, but one thing I've noticed in re-posting all of these daily (heh) journals is that the reverse is just as true - I'd forgotten about a good deal of this label business. At the time I was just focused on doing trades, mailing off orders, listening to new stock so I could describe it properly on the store website...*

*Missing the details and wanting to appreciate them is the impetus of a lot of blogging. I guess the desire to put those details into broader strokes and bigger contexts is the impetus behind biographies. Maybe it's time I started mine?)*

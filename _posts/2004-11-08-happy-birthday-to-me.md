Yep, I'm a Scorpio. Now a 32 year old Scorpio - the most aggressive of all the signs.

"But anyway I don't believe in it. I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself..."

(Bonus point for anyone who can name the reference - hint: in the original the sign being discussed was Sagittarius, "the most philosophical of all the signs...").

_(Everyone can do math and see which number is creeping up on me now... so why even bother posting it? I am large - I contain multitudes.)_

_(Also, I still dig that Blitzkrieg album. The reissue was brilliant.)_

_(About the above note, this was from the Livejournal days when you could add 'music' and 'mood' tags to whatever you were writing, and on that post I had listed Blitzkrieg's "A Time of Changes" album. And yep, I still dig it, though honestly I prefer the rawer demo-era stuff. And why did they ever not replicate that high 'solo' guitar bit on the outro of the song "Blitzkrieg" on this 1985 rerecording?)_

Something I've been talking about for a while is about to get kicked off - an e-newsletter for Alpha Draconis Records and Unsung Heroes Records. It'll be news about the label, features about the bands, members, other projects of members, etc., an editor's column (by yours truly), and more. The first issue will be pretty small, but I'm hoping to be able to put in some good content in future issues, hopefully with the members of ADR and UHR contributing.

While it will be primarily a newsletter, I hope it grows to be a bit more than that. But to do that, I'd need some feedback from readers - which means I need readers. If you haven't already, go to http://www.alphadraconisrecords.org/ (Dead Link) and put your email address in the subscription box. The first issue goes out on January 13, so hurry.

(And if you're in a UHR or ADR band, I will email you separately about submitting content for the second issue - or, if you want to jump the gun, email me - preferably at my ADR account, but I read all my email addys so I'll get it eventually...)

Oh yeah, I need a title - ideas, anyone?

*(I recently found the archive of those newsletters in one of my drive-sorting missions - I managed to keep this up, regularly on every 13th of the month, for ten or eleven months. I should think about adding those to this blog as well, because they contain as much of a snapshot of my musical history as any other post here, and I had some pretty good interviews with bands here and there, getting beyond what most of the terrible zines and even worse big music press bothered to do.)*

Too often people forget about those pesky New Year's Resolutions by MLK day (that's January 15 or so for non-US people...). I put my resolutions down in an earlier blog post since they mostly related to me and my musical activities and because I expected to be held to them.

Well, I'm pleased to say that the newsletter thing is going well. We've had two out already (one monthly, always on the 13th), and we have features planned for the next one. ADR has just signed a new band and the details will be forthcoming.

ADR also managed to get the new Vrolok albums out, which has been keeping me busy lately. However, that has cut into my work time on other musical fronts. Namely:

- I WILL begin working on both Dauder Sofa AND *Letters From Hell*. I will have at least one song for each done by the end of February.

Well, I dropped the ball on this one. I have nothing. So, let me have it.

*(Funny how even back then I was trying to use the blog as accountability/a spur to get my own stuff done. Again, as I noted in my previous entry's comments, I WAS getting a lot done - just not in my own music. Maybe that's where the rust set in...)*

Needless to say, I've been busy lately.

Between home improvements, job improvements, sanity-saving vacation, and the daily grind, my original plan for releasing new UHR albums was pushed back. After Michael was born, I had about six albums lined up to be released, and I thought I'd get them out one or two a month for the first few months, until he got old enough to not quite require constant attention.

Again, needless to say, that isn't exactly what happened. But I'm finally back on the horse.

In addition to getting a new home for the UHR website, I finally gave it a much-needed update in appearance, layout, and infrastructure, and also got it updated with...

UHR'S NEWEST RELEASES:

- UHR075: DEMONTAGE - *Sacrilege 'n' Miscreancy*

- UHR076: BLACK TORMENT - *Obscurum II: The Return of the King* 

Demontage was a band who has impressed me since I heard their first demo, *Madness Disease*. They have a new bassist and now a full-length album, and I think they made everything good about their demo even better: the song structures are very unconventional (bordering on bizarre), the drumming very old-school (as in the Bill Ward/Les Binks style of old jazzy rock-metal drumming), and the guitar work and vocals of Spatilomantis (S.o.S.) are now even better than before. In addition, their new bassist breathes fire on the four-string, giving a thick, robust low end that really keeps the songs moving when SoS takes off on his dual-lead assaults.

As for Black Torment, I've been a fan since I heard several of their self-released albums from the early '00s. *Obscurum II* was originally released on another label, but is now OOP there, and so Angzerhornbroals asked me to rerelease it with some bonus tracks - and I liked the album so much that I agreed. It's sick, and morbidly evil, and not for the weak.

As I discussed before, these releases are the first in UHR's new method of production and duplication: I'm springing for pro-duplicated CDRs with on-disc printing, which costs more but is higher quality, looks better, and results in longer-lasting products. No more fucking around with the labels and stuff.

And this is so easy that I'm revamping the UHR back catalog. As of now, we are printing no more older UHR titles - as we sell off what we have, we will be slowly reissuing the older albums in this new pro-duplicated format. The first two of our older albums to be released this way are Festering Sore *Chlorine for the Gene Pool* and Rampage *Monolith to an Abandoned Past*. If you have preferences for what older UHR albums to get reissued next, let us know by e-mail.

As always, you can find all UHR releases available at the Alpha Draconis Records Webstore.

*(More of those dead links hanging out there like bad, old snapshots. I can't remember now if those aforementioned home improvements were improvements or repairs, but either way I remember periods where I had to deal with things on the house and it ate up ALL my music time. I must have been working on these releases for weeks to get two of them done at this particular time.*

*Also, the two albums are out of print. Demontage is still going strong, and they of course have the rights to this release so they may be releasing (or maybe already have released) it at some point. I've completely lost contact with Angzer, so I have no idea what's up with Black Torment. One day I need to track these people down and see what's become of everyone.*

*Also, I must have discovered the wonders of Dimeadozen about this time, because the Dire Straits boot I had listed in the old "Listening to" field from LiveJournal was one of the first ones I remember downloading. The Boston show from some time around this one was even better.)*

I forgot how hard some of this shit was to play. And how FAST some of it was (or, rather, how fast it required me to play tightly). I've been practicing the more troublesome songs on *Bellum* while recording the easier songs, but I'm rapidly running out of those.

Overall, I'm quite happy with how this is turning out. The previous album was so squashed, production-wise, that this one will 'breathe' a lot more and thus should sound better even if I rerecorded exactly the same parts for everything. Plus the last one's source waves were only at 22KHz (due to a small HD), so that'll be another plus - as if the better drum synth wasn't enough on its own.

I may need some help finding a better instrument synth (or at least better patches for the EDIROL VSC I'm using now). If anyone knows what I'm talking about and can help, please do.

On the flipside of the worries above, I'm really stoked about the sounds I'm getting. I'm still using the V on some stuff, but the SG is getting quite a workout too, and with my new amp I'm getting a much better sound. Or sounds, really - I'm having a lot of fun tweaking the sounds so that each song will have its own sound - "Soulsword" will have that SG-rumbling sound like on "Displeasures", while I used tighter, more trebly sounds for faster things like "Rainbow Skies". This will be quite a change from my usual MO where I'm almost anal about making sure every track has exactly the same sound and mix and such. That will make mixing a bit lengthier in the end (since I can't just plop the same mix setting on each track and export), but will ultimately make for a much stronger product, I think.

Well, back to the salt mines....

*(This issue with tempos is noted in my notebook as well. Nemesis and The Vow in particular had to be slowed down a few BPM, but ultimately I think it worked out better.)*

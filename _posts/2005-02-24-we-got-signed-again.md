And this time I feel fairly sure that it will turn out better, since there's no other band's 'manager' to fuck things up for us. Suffering Jesus Productions in Canada has agreed to release Rampage - *Devilution* on pro-CD.

What is *Devilution*?

I'm glad you asked. It will basically compile all of Rampage's recorded output with Aerik on vocals to date - It will be the offical release of *CRIMSON FROST*, and will have all of the *Displeasures...* EP and the two tracks from the Websingle as well.

(Funny - I always knew "Crimson Frost" would never get released for one reason or another. But I confess this is one of the best possible reasons - Thanks Evil Edith! :) )

Anyway, the timetable is 'a few months', so you'll have to wait just a bit longer, but I hope you will all feel it's worth it in the end.

In other plus-side commentary, Death Beast finally finished recording everything for the album, so now the ball is totally in my court as I mix and produce this thing into a modern masterpiece of thrash, that will finally show all the suckers out there how VIOLENT thrash is supposed to be. What that means, also, is that this is the only thing in my way towards starting work on the next Rampage release...

*(We all know now how this story turned out, but it's still nice to see the enthusiasm we had for what we were doing back then, spurred on by the enthusiasm others had in what we were doing. Reposting the history of my old blog into my new one is really helping me reconnect with that. I would say 'hopefully it will turn out better this time', but I don't mean in this old way, where 'better'=validation from external sources. What I want now is to be better than I was at writing and playing the music I hear in my head. We'll see how that goes...*

*I'm also shocked to see that from early-mid-January I'd said I hadn't started recording yet, and now end-of-February I'm saying I totally finished the Death Beast album. I had no idea I worked that fast. I wish I could make myself do that again...)*

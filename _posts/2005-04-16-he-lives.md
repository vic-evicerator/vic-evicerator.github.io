He, of course, being the infamous **JASON GORTICIAN**, the man of a thousand screen names. I just happened to catch him on AIM last night after something like 3 years of no contact. As much as things have changed, as the cliche goes, things are still the same. Except that there's some slight chance of a Gortician reformation - with new members ;) More details as they arise.

*(I'm a lazy bastard.*

*I've known Jason since I was on the usenet newsgroups (like alt.rock-n-roll.metal.death) in the mid-90s. I had gotten used to him just dropping off posting for months and then coming back, but once I got off usenet I kinda lost contact - until now, where we're both on Facebook. But between Usenet and FB he would just pop up now and then, we'd talk for a week, and then BOOM-Gone again. Enthusiasm would overtake me and we'd want to get something done together, and it would never happen. Maybe someday...)*

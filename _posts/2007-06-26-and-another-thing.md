LiveJournal recently added Tags, which I think are a much better way for me to keep track of related/serial posts than the old, cumbersome Memories function. I've only just now gotten around to activating it, though.

Currently I've tagged entries back to December 2005 and will finish up the rest soon. I've got tags for lyrics, band news, label news, and essays, and will ultimately get tags up for each album as well so you can view all the 'writing of' and 'lyrics' posts together. If anyone else wants anything else tag-wise out of this blog, let me know.

*(It's not much of a post, but the fact that I mentioned this feature at all shows that my mindset now isn't that far off from my mindset then - being organized and making it easier to find the right thing is always worthwhile.*

*Not that I always wisely use the time I save. I guess there's a bit too much of David Lamb in me.)*

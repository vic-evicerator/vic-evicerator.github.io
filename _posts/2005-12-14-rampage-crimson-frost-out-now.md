After a year of delays, Rampage's new album *CRIMSON FROST* has finally been released on Unsung Heroes Records. Vic and Aerik are joined by Dante (Eyes of Ligeia) on session drums, and together they create raw, dark, epic, and evil black metal.

This disc is available at Alpha Draconis Records' webstore. Visit Rampage's Myspace site for samples or the Rampage webpage for more information:

*(Heh - EVERY link listed above is now dead. Funny how that works. I still need to get these posted on the UHR web archive site. I was just happy to have it out, so I find it strange but understandable that I wasn't more happy at being able to announce it's release. It felt more like 'finally' than 'hey, new stuff, check it out!')*

JUDAS PRIEST, that is... I'm totally psyched.

After seeing them on the Plainfiller tour 15 years ago (my first arena concert, btw), it'll be interesting to see how they compare to their 'old days'. If the DVD in the Angel of Retribution book-set is anything to go by, it'll be awesome.

(To anyone who's seen them already this tour - does Halford still do The Robot during "Metal Gods"? And did they really drop Worth Fighting For from the set?)

As for work/business news, the Misantropical Painforest discs are in Ellenwood GA now, about to be routed to the local delivery trucks. ADR's new webstore (and revamped website) could be up by Friday.

And, no, I haven't forgotten about my Black Sabbath essay series - I'm just behind on writing it up. Volume 4 is done, and just needs proofreading before I post it.

*(It's been nine years but I still remember this day so well. I cover the show thoughts pretty well in the show recap/review that I posted about 3 weeks after this, but the day leading up to it was nice too. I worked that day, but I brought my clothes to work to change afterward - there would have been no sense in driving home to change, scarf a quick meal, and then race back. Since Toby worked a couple of blocks from me, I just changed clothes after work and then Toby and I went to eat downtown and wait around to drive to the arena, which was just a few minutes south from where we were.*

*We ended up eating in a combination Taco Bell/KFC that's no longer there anymore - now it's been turned into a Greek restaurant. That whole section of town has been drastically improved over time - understandable, since GSU had just bought the Rialto Theater right around the corner from here and the re-centering of campus ended up causing that whole section of town to get refurbished. We still had to deal with odd homeless people, and one of them accosted us for money while we were eating. I just ignored the dude, but Toby was mean to him, which caused him to threaten to attack me. Why the redirection of anger was beyond me, so I told the guy myself to fuck off, and then he left us alone.*

*Anyway, then we drove to Lakewood (I STILL refuse to call it Hi-Fi Buys Amphitheater) and enjoyed the fuck out of the show. This first reunion they did was a barn-burner. But that's a description for another blog post.)*

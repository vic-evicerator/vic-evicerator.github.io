Yep, I've earned it. Three days ago I mailed off the *Devilution* masters and artwork to Suffering Jesus Productions. It's LITERALLY only a matter of time until this baby comes out. A life's goal, already accomplished.

The icing on this cake is that Death Beast is finally out of my studio too - I finished the final mix and mailed it to Black Goat the same day I mailed off the *Devilution* stuff. For the first time in three years, I have no currently-active recording projects going on - it's all writing.

But first, I'm gonna kick back, relax, and enjoy these laurels for a little bit. They're rather comfy.

*(Of course I remember well how SJP fucked us over by not releasing this - but until I re-dug this post up I forgot we had gotten all the way to mailing them the masters and artwork. I also forgot that I had "Devilution" and the first Death Beast album going out right at the same time. I guess I was happy - for a little while.)*

Tying in with this announcement is a new one - the Death Beast Website has been updated:

Includes pictures and discography, will include more in-depth bio information and lyrics later.

*(Yep, another one of those dead links. I'm thinking about web design and learning some new design tricks, and once I get some more updated photos I'll get it reposted. Eventually.)*

And dangling part 1s. I'm working on the next one. Just busy. Because...

Breath of the Dragon #3 is out now. Good interview with ADR's newest signees, Midwynter. We've also overhauled the ADR website so it looks much better now - or at least more unified with the webstore. Also some UHR tidbits in there.

And now that means I can get some real UHR work done. That's next on the plate. That and demolishing the christian 'metal' fantasies of poseurs.

*(I must have just sent BotD #3 out about an hour before posting this, judging from the time stamp. I still remember getting the Midwynter demo in my PO Box that month and being blown away. The Vrolok discs were still warm from the presses, but we didn't have any idea of what to do next. Normally that wouldn't worry me so much, except that even here, less than a year before we would call it quits, we were still in an expansionist mindset. I guess also that business was booming, because I don't remember money being an issue with getting the Midwynter released - it was more a matter of having something to put out.*

*Interesting are the perspectives of hindsight. I wonder what I'll think of today in a few years?)*

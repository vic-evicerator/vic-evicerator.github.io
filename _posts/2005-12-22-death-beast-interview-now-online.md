Metal Nightmare Webzine Issue 19 is now online at http://www.metalnightmare.com/ (Dead Link)

In addition to a buttload of reviews there are 12 interviews, among them one of DEATH BEAST. A couple of weeks ago we all got on IRC and answered the interview, and now you can read the drunken results. Unfortunately our photo shoot is still weeks in the future, so the pics up are the old ones and don't include the new bassist. Oh well. One hurdle at a time.

Also, a happy Winter Solstice to you all - the REAL reason for the season.

*This is how my life always was, apparently. No wonder I took such a long break. I need to be more ruthless about saying no, and apparently let go of some things I think I need to hang on to. That's one positive thing about this reposting thing, though - my history is important to me, and going through it, I see the difference between what I value now and what I used to value then. Where it's still the same, it makes the decision to keep that much easier.)*

... and vacation is exactly where I'm headed for the next week. But since I've had one of my regular long silences, I figure I owe an update as well.

I know you're tired of seeing me say "Bellum is almost done", but it really is. It's like this - I have drum programming tweaks to three songs that are completed on my laptop that need to be imported into the studio PC. Then I have three or four songs that the bass is buried because of EQ issues, and I need to tweak those. Then, there are overall minor 'spit-n-polish' details - the effect on this solo, the clean guitar there is too low, that kind of shit. It's the nitty-gritty, I'm-99%-there-and-the-last-1%-takes-forever frustrating time. But it's SOOOO damn close to perfect. You guys will be really happy to see how big an improvement this is over the old version - and not just in the vocals.

The Death Beast demo compilation I mentioned before is compiled, and inserts are being printed as we speak. I need to master the disc and that will be ready, soon after vacation. It will be released concurrently with the Chemikiller/Rampage split Venom tribute (which ALSO has a damn killer booklet. This pro-CDR thing is GREAT!).

A few weeks ago I saw the Antichrist Vanguard tour when they stopped here in Atlanta - Gravewurm, Nachtmystium, Negative Plane, Angelcorpse, and Watain. All the bands kicked ass, I got a CD and some free swag from Funeral of Gravewurm, and I also got pics of all the bands. I'll be posting those shortly. In addition, I decided that for the next Breath of the Dragon newsletter I will interview Funeral about the goings-on of the tour. So often people think the underground is all internet and local shows, so something like this is a good way to show people that it may be smaller, but it's just as viable as 'the mainstream' - and damn more fun, heavy, and evil.

And with this post, the last thing gets crossed off my 'to-do' list, and I can vacation in fun, sun, and beer for a whole week. Seeya later...

*(Seven years on and I still remember this night - it was a great time, one of the first shows I'd been to in a long time, and certainly one of the heaviest. I need to dig up those pics.)*

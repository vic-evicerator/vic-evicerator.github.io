Still just nose on the grindstone, recording, mixing, recording. Rhythms are mostly done, fortunately, so leads and clean guitars are next and bass last. I have some ideas for a new song for *Bellum*, but may not have time to pull it off before the baby gets here. Especially considering the doctor has said it could almost literally be any time. I guess I'll find out...

*(I never noted any ideas in my notebook, so I think it might just have been thematic ideas. Too bad - I'd like to remember what I was thinking.)*

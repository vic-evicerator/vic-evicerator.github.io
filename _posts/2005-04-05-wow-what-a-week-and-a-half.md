On the PLUS side, though:

Check up for news on the upcoming, very imminent release of the MISANTROPICAL PAINFOREST album *Winds Saturate With Inhumane Longing*.

I also took a trip with Toby to the music store this weekend - I came out one bass lighter and $100 richer, so I finally have room and cash for that new Strat I've been wanting for quite a while now. Toby came out with a lightly used Line 6 head (Can't remember the model number now). He also finally heard the first test mix of the Death Beast album. His comment - "This fucking rules". Or something similar. If not for this damn hour-loss thanks to DST this would've been a great past week and a half.

Also, keep your eyes on the UHR page for a few new announcements I've been waiting to make. Now that everything is cemented, I can make them - once I find time. Anybody know where I can pick up an extra hour or two? :(

*(Another one of those snapshot-style dead links, though I could repost the ADR site if I wanted to - I still have the files.*

*I still think it was weird that so many things were happening in 'the real world' all at once. I still remember all the fuming over the Schiavo case.*

*And I guess this answers the question from the last post of what I was so busy about - it was both mixing Death Beast and working out the details for releasing the first Misantropical Painforest album. Even a decade later, I can still say this is one of the albums I'm most proud of having a hand in releasing. It's been far too long since I've talked to Kutcheck - I should make an effort to reconnect. Because, if the list at the top of this post can tell us anything besides the fact that I like bad jokes, it's that Time and Fate can be real bitches about taking the last chance you thought you had to do something.)*

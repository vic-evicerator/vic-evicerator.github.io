Well, as I guess you saw, I did title the newsletter. "Breath of the Dragon" was the best my sleep-deprived mind could conjure, but it fits.

Anyway, issue #2 is almost upon us, so if you're not subscribed already please do so at http://www.alphadraconisrecords.org/ (Dead Link) - and if you're a UHR or ADR band, check your email for solicitations for content. I'm planning a mini-feature interview with Vrolok concerning the upcoming releases of Resurgence III and the Resurgence I reissue. Both the newsletter and the double-release date are slated for next week.

Also, in the meantime, I kept beating against my computer and managed to get it to work mix-wise - and I even found the source tracks for the Venom tribute I did ages ago! Good, because the first mixes I had were total dog-shit soundwise. That and the Hellgoat/Panzerfaust split will be out on UHR next month, and I think Aerik may have some more surprises for us soon...

*(Too bad those surprises from Aerik never materialized, or the suggested pro-tracked tracks he asked me for in the comments of that post. This was the period when I was at my busiest with the two labels and the webstore, so I'm a bit surprised I managed to get ANYTHING done. And this was still when my old PC was in resurrection mode and my current PC hadn't even been built.)*

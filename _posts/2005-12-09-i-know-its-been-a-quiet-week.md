... but not without reason. I've been busy. With the impending release of *Crimson Frost*, I've been busy with layouts, mastering, last-minute touchups, and the like. Just last night, in fact, I recorded the intro and outro - both derived from a piece I've had written for quite some time but didn't know what to do with. Between these last-minute polishes and general life stuff there hasn't been much time for blogging. Hopefully this will make up for this release being about a year late.

(Though, as already discussed, that isn't really our fault...).

If you want a preview of this release, Aerik posted the new version of "Ritual Curse" on his Serpentine Lust Productions Myspace page: http://www.myspace.com/serpentinelustproductions. (Dead Link)

Also, we've been looking ahead to the NEXT Rampage release, the rehearsal demo *Fucked Raw*. But that will warrant its own post...

*(Ah, another one of those dead links. Myspace... oh, man, I remember only that it was so bad that I barely interacted on it and then let mine go dormant. Aerik was made of stronger stuff than I, though, hence the link above. But I guess even that took its toll...)*

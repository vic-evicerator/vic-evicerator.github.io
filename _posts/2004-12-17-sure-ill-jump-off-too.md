*(This was when many friends had a laundry list of questions they posted to their blog and answered, the usual kind of 'get to know me' meme-post. These are the best kind of snapshots - interesting how much has changed, yet how little, in these past ten(#) years...)*

9\. *What was your biggest failure?* Beyond my control - Goat Horn backing out of the split. The one that WAS under my control was getting ripped off by that \[asshole\] on eBay when I tried to get the Black Sabbath Box Set.

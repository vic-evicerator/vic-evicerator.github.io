Yep, it's done - I FINALLY got all of *Bellum Aeternum* mixed and semi-mastered. I just need to burn it and get it to Aerik for vocalization.

It feels good to finally have this done after so long, and the reasons why it took so long will occupy the next series of posts I'll put up here, discussing the A-to-Z of how this project got done. Problems, pitfalls, ideas, what's changed... all that kind of stuff. In short, though, I must say that I really went even farther than I thought I could with my old studio setup.

And, so, as soon as I can complete the hardware and data migration to my new PC, I'll start cranking out some new stuff there too. I know a couple of Death Beast projects are somewhat overdue, but I'll also be working on the new Rampage single "Destroy Yourself for Satan".

But, for just a bit, I'm going to rest, relax, and reflect. Though I'm done with my part, I realize it will be a while before the rest of you can hear it. Trust me, though, if you've followed Rampage this far you'll be very happy with what I've done with the album, and I can't wait to hear what Aerik will do from there.

*(It's a shame that it's still at this stage. Instrumental release or give it another crack on my own?)*

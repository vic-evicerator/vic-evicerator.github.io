I think the funniest thing about this song is that reading this will take longer than listening to the song. By a factor of ten. Much like nobody really writes 12-bar, I don't think anyone really writes grindcore. Just blast-blast-puke-blast and it's over. Or so it seems to my untrained ears. Anyway, it's in the middle of the first boombox session of Paul and I, and he says we need to do a grindcore song called "Cocksucker". I have no idea what prompted this. But coming hot on the heels of the first recordings of "The Wigglesnake Blues", "Kill Ya Tonite", and "DeadRot", I knew what to expect.

It was basically inspired by those "momo"/"camel boy" type songs by SOD. Just make it short and unintelligible. I didn't even bother with riffs - I just blasted on the open E as fast as I could while Paul did the same on his drums, and I just started gurgling unintelligibly. About halfway through I got a slight lyrical idea and start ranting:

```
Suckmycocklickmycock
blahblahblahblahblahblahblah
andlickmyballslickmyass
suckitallyoufuckingbitch
cocksucker
cocksucker
suck my cock
suck my cock!
```

John Tardy would be proud, even if I never mention volleyballs.

*(Again, reading my 'new' thoughts on this will take much longer than listening to the song itself. It highlights how much I like to work humor into my music, reinforced of course by the fact that I not only rerecorded this for the 2006 release, but that we also did a sequel, "Cocksucker II", for the Misogyny II EP. Why? I don't know, except that Whitman's words apply now as well as ever - I am large, I contain multitudes.)*

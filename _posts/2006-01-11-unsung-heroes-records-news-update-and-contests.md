For the new year, I've given the UHR site a facelift with the latest update.

The news is on the main page, but one item I'd like to draw attention to: CONTESTS!

http://www.mindspring.com/~lordvic/uhr/contest.htm  (Dead Link)

Basically, Rampage wants to do T-shirts, and we want cover art for our upcoming rehearsal demo Fucked Raw, so we're running contests for each, with the winners getting some free swag.

(also, there's an unofficial third contest - anyone who can make a UHR logo like the top of the pages but make it look metallic instead of just gray. No prize here but gratitude and bragging rights, unfortunately...)

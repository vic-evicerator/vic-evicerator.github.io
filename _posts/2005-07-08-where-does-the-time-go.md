Down the drain, when you're sick.

PSA: If you get pink eye, TAKE DECONGESTANTS.

See, there are these ducts that connect your eye sockets to your upper sinuses. That's how those wacky Japanese people can drink milk and squirt it out of their eyes. Well, since I had viruses in my eye, and they were lowering my defenses, and my nose was all plugged up, my immune system was lower than its usual sterling self and some bacteria decided to get in on the party - so they lodged in all that nice snot and started my body making - guess what? More snot. The thick goopy kind that just won't come out - that keeps you up all night because you can't breathe easy enough to go to sleep... and with less sleep your immune system suffers, and more bacteria get in on the fun...

... so you see what I've been dealing with this past week. Fortunately, the doctor gave me some REALLY good decongestants and some nice, mild antibiotics, so I should be fine.

I hope so, anyway - in 14 hours I'll be getting on Majesty of the Seas for three days of debauchery, sun, fun, good food, high life... and maybe even a hurricane. Figures - fate, bitch that she is, always has to slip something in. Like an orange alert after the London stuff the day before we're supposed to go isn't enough...

And, guess what? I'm STILL behind on my essay series and on getting my Priest show thoughts written up.

At least the Misantropical Painforest album is out, and seemingly being received well.

I gotta get to bed - gotta be nice and sharp if I'm going to enjoy this cruise thingee.

*(Another nice little reminder of the real-life things that went on while I was doing all my music stuff. Jackie had just changed jobs a few months ago and it was her new bosses who took the whole office, and their spouses, on a cruise to Nassau. Silly me didn't think to find out where Compass Point Studios was or I'd have visited it. To have been so close to the birthplace of so much metal I love and not even known it... almost as frustrating as my London trip four years later.)*

Well, perhaps my last entry was a bit alarmist. Aerik seems to be doing better, and things are proceeding apace. We finally got a first test mix of the song "Crimson Frost" and the performance is amazing. A few tweaks and this CDR will be ready to go - and then on to the future of Rampage.

And that will be more immediate than I wanted, unfortunately, because unresolvable equipment difficulties have prevented me from being able to record bass for the Chemikiller "Evilspeak" album. So, now, that'll be Ramrod solo again. It's a shame because I had some great bass lines worked out, he was looking forward to my work on the album, and I was looking forward to being a part of it.

So, Fate giveth and Fate taketh away. Fuckin' bitch.

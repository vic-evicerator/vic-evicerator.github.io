As of today, I have half a bass track and two songs worth of lead guitar to finish. I rattled off most of the bass tracks today in about four hours of playing hooky.

But I won't have time for any new material, nor do I think I could find a 'space' in the story to fit a new song anyway, so new material will have to wait until the next album.

Also, the new kid probably won't wait until April 21. He might not even wait until next week...

*(That answers that - I think my 'ideas' from earlier were just my usual way of saying "I'm thinking about X". I must have been getting more busy, because I don't have many notes in my notebook journal about what was keeping me from finishing right here. I wouldn't finish those aforementioned tracks for another 8 days.)*

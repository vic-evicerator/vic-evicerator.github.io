The old black-and-white picture of me with my guitar that used to be above was taken in 1996. Just before I cut off all my hair I decided to take some pics of me with my hair and guitars to use for publicity. I thought, at the time, that people actually cared whether I was in metal and had long hair or not.

What's worse is that I cared whether they cared.

Not anymore.

Though I've let a few pics of me post-cut get out, I never really actively sought any publicity with my current visage, until recently. Death Beast is taking off and I wanted to be able to promote it properly, including band photos. So, we decided to have a photo shoot today, and you can see one of the results above. (I uploaded two pictures here, but don't know how to tell you to view the other - click on that one, I think...).

A few of the others are put up, bigger, on the Myspace pages for me and for Death Beast.

As for my own take on things - the hair doesn't matter shit. I look way more metal now than I did back then. Not that I give a fuck.

And, when you think about it, THAT's what makes it more metal. Not my 'look', but that I truly don't give a fuck for your opinion. I AM WHO AM.

And if you have a problem with that, I direct you to the lower right corner of the picture.

_(For those who didn't see my old blog, the 'new' picture is the same as the one above here, but cropped a little differently so you can see me flipping off the camera - with my hand in the aforementioned lower right corner. Just lazy I guess. Maybe I'll fix it some day.)_

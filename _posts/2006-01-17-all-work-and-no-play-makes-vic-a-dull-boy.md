Today was technically a day off work but I was busier than ever. In addition to programming drums and almost finishing off the last song for Misogyny II, I was keeping up with a recent surge in orders, related to this:

Yes, THREE DOZEN orders I have to package and ship. Not to mention I'm not totally done with the cutting and folding of the discs. I hope I have enough slimcases....

Anyway, if you're one of the lucky winners, I'll be mailing these out over the course of this week.

*(A live link that points to a post pointing to a dead link. Oh well. What happened was that, at the time, I was an active member of the Metal Rules message board, and one of the denizens on there, Iced Ray, just crossed some big post threshold - 20K or 30K posts. To celebrate, he contacted me about wanting to buy a dozen copies to just give away to winners of a thread contest he posted on there, and then one dozen became two and then two became three. We kept it under wraps until the contest was over, so this was just the final announcement - I knew about it for a few weeks before this.*

*The place became a cesspool, populated by idiots and ruled by morons and hypocrites, but at the time I thought it was really worthwhile. And things like this were why. Ray had no reason to celebrate his own milestone by giving away 3 dozen of my discs, but that's how cool the place used to be. I lament the loss, but I certainly don't miss the timesuck that it was even when it was good. Imagine if I had even less time for music, posting, et cetera than I do now...*

*How the fuck did I ever get ANYTHING done back then? Did I even sleep?)*

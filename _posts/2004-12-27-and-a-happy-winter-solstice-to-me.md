Some odds'n'ends stocking stuffers 
A shitload of money that will eventually go towards a new guitar

Also, a new tradition in x-mas meals has begun this year. My wife just changed jobs a few months ago, so this is her first xmas at the new job - and on the last day before the holiday, at the company lunch, the bosses handed out their usual xmas gift to every one of the employees. Now, I've heard of employers giving away hamhocks or turkeys before - but these classy people gave away entire beef tenderloins! So, instead of the traditional ham-n-turkey crap, the entire family had hand-trimmed tenderloin steak - and there's still like half a dozen steaks left over. And, apparently, they do this EVERY year. Yummy.

*(Some things change, some things don't, but fortunately one of the things that hasn't is the Christmas steaks. The guitar referred to here was my Red Strat, but at the time it was still quite a few months away.)*

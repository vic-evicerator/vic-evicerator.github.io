(Bonus point - name the movie)

It is, indeed, a brand new year, and we rang it in in a suitably decadent manner. Family, friends, food, and drinking.

With the new year comes resolutions, of course, and I've alluded to one set of resolutions already, but I'm making it official here - I resolve to have the following releases recorded by the end of April:

* Rampage - Misogyny 2 
* Rampage - Fucked Raw 
* Rampage - Bellum Aeternum 
* Rampage - one more thing TBA

And, by the end of the year, I hope to have finished (or at least written and mostly underway recording-wise) Death Beast *The Onslaught*.

Now you all have more basis for bitching at me if it doesn't happen - and I'll do my best to keep you from bitching.

*(The 'one more thing TBA' was a rerecording of all the songs from the first Misogyny EP - with the plan originally to have both the new one and the full rerecording on a single disc.*

*And, in unusual form, I DID keep the bulk of this promise - I finished all of those Rampage recordings by the beginning of April. I knew our second son was due at the end of April, so I had a deadline, and the thinking was to backlog releases I could dole out slowly while the new kid grew to where he wasn't quite so much work, and so by the end of the year I could be recording and writing again.*

*Best laid plans and all that. Nobody told me that effort with kids wasn't linear, and was instead exponential. And they're MORE work once they get to school, not less.*

*Oh, and for the few who didn't know, the quote was from the movie **Better Off Dead**, one of my comedy favorites.)*

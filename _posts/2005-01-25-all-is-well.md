The radio interview on Radio Glendon was a success, I think. Many, many thanks to the Lousy Lout and Satanicharisma for the publicity option. As you may or may not have seen from Aerik's blog, their CBGB show got cancelled due to a flaky drummer, so we were hyping something that didn't exist. :( Ah well...

For any who couldn't make it, we have an mp3 of the interview slot, and the songs they played were Displeasures/The Final Day/Rampage (WS version) before and the new versions of Black Flames and Ritual Curse afterward.

Anyway, the final mixes of Crimson Frost will be coming this week or next, and so I begin the process of making the packaging and looking around for duplication options. Since I hate burning discs, I'm really thinking pro-CDR for this, with the shrinkwrap/jewlecase/whole nine yards. I probably won't have to charge more than like $6 for it, either, which is good.

The next big thing for me, of course, is both finishing the Death Beast album for those guys and recording the bass for Chemikiller. Fortunately I'm working on two different machines for both of those projects so one won't get in the way of the other and I can truly work on them in parallel. I want these done quickly because the next Rampage is really quite ready to get worked on in earnest, but now is a time to clean my plate before piling more shit on it.

*(Ah, the arrogance of youth. It turns out that Crimson Frost wouldn't be out for another year, no thanks to, well, you know, and of course the Chemikiller thing wouldn't work out either.*

*I'd forgotten that the final recording of the first Death Beast album was still a ways in the future. I know it was released September 2005, but strange to see that it was so soon that we still hadn't even started our final studio sessions. Man, when did I ever have that much free time?)*

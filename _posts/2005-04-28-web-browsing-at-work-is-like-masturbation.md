Everyone does it.

Everyone KNOWS everyone does it.

Yet everyone has to pretend like nobody does it, and woe befall he who lets himself get caught.

So the voyeurs known as Internal Tech Support have made it known via the grapevine that Vic better stop jerking off at work, so to speak. So my wankitude has dropped. Obviously. When I'm not at work I have better things to do. Ironic, isn't it? There's some kind of metaphor there for the state of our worker-bee-level culture, but I'll let the philosophers sort that out.

Personally, I'll just try to find a way to keep up with shit. So if you see/hear less from me, you know why - and, the way it's looking, it seems that good ol' fashioned Email may be the preferable method of contact.

And, anyone know where I can get at DIRT-CHEAP laptop? I've spied a few on e-bay, but wondering if I could find something a bit less dependent on the bidding proclivities of others.

*(Little did I know how much this one decision, to invest in a laptop, would be the biggest hindrance to me getting more done. While I thought I would program music and write blog posts and web pages on the laptop in my downtime, what I really ended up doing was gaming. A LOT.*

*Still, it's funny to see the little intrusions of life into my music activities. Or is it the other way around? Depends on where you're standing, I guess.)*

I guess something a bit more informational than historical is long overdue, because I've been getting no comments on anything. Odd, since I thought these were some funny stories I had for the Misogyny I songs. Come on, Jill's ass getting fat wasn't the LEAST bit funny?

Anyway, the last couple of weeks have been a blur - so much going on that I haven't made much headway on the Rampage material we're working on now. I'm still one song away from finishing *Misogyny II* and I unearthed a couple more tracks for the 'Fucked Raw' rehearsal release - this may end up being a full-length by the time it's over.

I've also just gotten in the last Barbarian Wrath/Witches Brew pack, which means I finally have my first-ever pro-CD release in my grubby little hands. Early feedback seems VERY positive, which kinda justifies the three years it took to bring it to fruition. A little, anyway. However, a website problem at our ADR-site's host has kept me from posting the update, so I can't actually start making any lucre from this until that gets ironed out. Not that I need the money qua money, but ADR has a release schedule to keep up with, and we're falling a bit behind.

Also, this coming Thursday, Eyes of Ligeia will be playing a gig supporting Hellgoat at the release party for Hellgoat's new CD. Looking forward to that. Anyone in the Atlanta area on Thursday the 17th should try to make it. Which probably doesn't apply to any of my regular readers, but maybe some lucky soul will fall into this news and meet me there - I'll be in the Barbarian Wrath shirt.

In other news, I turned 33 last week (the 8th).

*(I'm glad for 'window on my life' posts like this, because again I forget how those various threads of my life wove together sometimes. I forgot that the Death Beast discs took so long to get to me, I forgot that I was working on all of this new material to finish before our second son was born, and I forgot that Eyes of Ligeia was starting to transition from studio to stage right here at the same time.)*

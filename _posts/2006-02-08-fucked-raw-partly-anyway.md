Today it is done.

After poring through the master tapes, adjusting mixes, dealing with shitty 'bassists', the final tracks selected for Fucked Raw have been mixed, burned, and mailed to Aerik for vocalization.

There's some good stories to go with the recording of this rehearsal demo and how it all came about, but I have to save SOMETHING for the liner notes.

The clock is ticking with about 10-11 weeks left to do two EPs and *Bellum*. Can I make it?

We'll see...

*(Fucked Raw was two rehearsal tracks that ballooned up to eight. Again, a story I must expand on some day. It bridged the gap between the tail end of the Crimson Frost recordings of the Misogyny II EP. Earlier today {7/29/2006 as I write this addendum} I found an old studio notes notebook that has the dates of these recordings of early 2006. The notes don't start until March 2006, but I make references to these rehearsal recordings, all of which were done basically through January 2006, with the final mixes taking up this week.*

*Again, the fictional history I created ended up tweaking the narrative I tell here, where freshly-recorded rehearsal tracks became 'tracks we recorded in various rehearsals last year that I dug up for release'. It's a shame we never got this stuff released. A few of these turned out worse in a few ways, from egregious mess-ups to an out-of-tune rhythm guitar, but a few turned out better than the real studio versions.)*

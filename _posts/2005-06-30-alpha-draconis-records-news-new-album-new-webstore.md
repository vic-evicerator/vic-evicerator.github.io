(news release - spread like the plague)

Big changes and new things are afoot at Alpha Draconis Records. First, we have just released our third album, MISANTROPICAL PAINFOREST *Winds Saturate With Inhumane Longing*. This album is a masterpiece of black metal from Finland, impossible to pidgeonhole or even really describe, except to say that all of the best elements of black metal are present and, overall, it's an epic, emotional masterpiece. Samples are available at the samples page of the ADR website.

Also, after the closing of BWV, Vic has decided to open up shop under the ADR banner, and now the new Alpha Draconis Records Webstore is finally open for business. You can get the Misantropical Painforest album now, as well as many other selections of all styles from the best of the underground. From the main ADR website, go to the 'Store' link. All former customers of BWV will be able to testify to our standards for price and service.

*(And while I remember this day, my mind goes to the song "To Bequeath the Tranquil Waters" from the album. I remember when I first met Kutcheck Gorealis while hanging out on Opyros' Barbarian Wrath IRC channel. He would send me samples of his music, and while I liked everything I heard, the Misantropical Painforest album he sent me was flat-out amazing, and it was in particular this one song that convinced me that this was something worth investing in. People crack on the name, or the cover, but I think they just don't get the Finnish sense of humor, or have too much of a varg-stick up their asses. Music is supposed to make you feel something, move you to other emotions, other times and places, and hearing that album was like a 70-minute ego trip. I still maintain it's one of the best releases I've ever put out on any of my banners.)*

(Previously titled "Fuck e-\[B\]ay")

Goddamn idiot put up a laptop for auction. I won it. Then he tells me he listed the wrong item and he doesn't really have a laptop to sell me - but he'll leave me positive feedback if I leave him positive feedback.

Like I'm going to REWARD his fraudulent idiocy.

I'm not out any $$$ so should I just leave him negative feedback or report him for Fraud? Ah, decisions, decisions....

Nevertheless, I won another laptop, so I'll be able to get more shit done soon.

Maybe even songwriting posts for the stuff on the pre-Bellum Rampage albums :)

*(Updated)*

I just got email from eBay's Fraud Protection division - It turns out that the ripoff seller mentioned above had his account suspended because of complaints from others, urging me not to complete any transactions with him, etc. etc. etc. Good to see they're on the ball this time.

*(The \[B\] above was a G, originally, which is one of the uncomfortable reminders of how much bigotry I was still a harbor for back then. Things like this are one of the more uncomfortable parts of going through my history like this - and woe betide anyone who goes back through all of the numerous music review I wrote for various and sundry places. Still, at least I grew out of it, and now I have the ability to clean up those kinds of things. Is it whitewashing the past? I might worry if this were some important cultural artifact that was widely and well known, but come on... it's just my blog and its dozen(s?) of readers.)*

Yes, sometimes the progress of life FORCES the end of procrastination. And thus good news mixes with bad.

The 'bad' news is that I must BUST MY ASS to finish mixing the Venom tracks and Bellum Aeternum in the next couple of weeks. Pronto.

The 'good' news is the reason why - after six years of obsolescence, I'm finally getting a new PC.

Not just 'getting', though - I'm going to build it myself. I've been reading up on hardware websites, reading how-to books, and in the not-too distant past watched my pop-in-law build his own. It's not beyond me, I don't think. It should be fun.

See, since we had a second kid last year, but never adjusted our withholdings, we got back a shitload more money than we expected this year. Even after the regular savings portion and stocking away an extra-large part for family vacation, I've got about $1500 to throw at this thing. So far, the things I've picked out are:

- CPU - Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 
- Motherboard - Intel DP965LT 
- Hard Drive - Seagate Barracuda SATA 7800RPM (size unsure - 160 or 250. Or maybe 2x160. The board does support RAID, after all...) 
- Memory - 2X1GB Crucial (board can run memory in dual-channel) 
- Board has embedded sound, but I'll also be adding my Maya44, assuming it works with such new hardware 
- OS - Win XP Pro (Vista is still too new)

I'll be dragging my Pioneer DVR111 dual-format DVD/CD writer over to serve as my optical drive. For an office suite I'm thinking about trying OpenOffice instead of paying the Micro$oft tax for 'real' Office. Anyone had any experience with it? Horror stories?

As for graphics, I'd like something okay but not a bank-breaker. I don't need some super-mongo overclocked beast. Comparing my gaming needs (about year-old games, max - Doom 3, Quake 4, Brothers in Arms/CoD2/MoH-PA/etc.) and price I'm thinking mostly about an nVidia GeForce 7900 or 7950, not sure which or which sub-line. I've also got to get a new monitor - I want a 17" flatpanel, so size is limited there, but I'm still way under budget so I want a really nice, fast one, good for gaming as well as general use. Suggestions welcome.

Anyway, I'll be buying and building within a month, so I have to clean off my old PC fast - which means until then, I'll be mixing my ass off.

Wish me luck...

*(Again, I'm happy for the time capsule of where I was with posts like this one. I'm still largely on the PC I ultimately built a month or so after this, though it's on Windows 8 and I've got an even better graphics card and sound card. My studio logs back up my timeline here - I kept wanting to say I was lazy, but looking over the posts of the past few months, again, from seven years later, I'm amazed I got as far as I did.*

*The trick is to not let taking it easy on my younger self turn into lack of personal drive in the present and near future.)*

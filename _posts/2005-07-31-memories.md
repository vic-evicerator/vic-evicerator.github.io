Just added some functionality when I saw how much crap I've put into my Live Journal here. I've started using the "Memories" function to highlight and organize the more important informational posts so that they don't get lost in the mists of time. Posts about lyrics, songs or albums, Rampage as a whole (history, that is, not news updates), and essays or essay series are Memories categories so you can somewhat quickly find those posts more easily.

If you use it, let me know what you think and if there need to be any improvements in categorization to make it more useful for you.

Oh yeah, almost got the Black Sabbath essay series done, and I think it's time to post some more lyrics... :)

*(Of course, as we all know, 'Memories' were superseded by tags, but again little housekeeping notes like this are glimpses into the day-to-day that is largely invisible to most of us, and that we really only notice when something changes.)*

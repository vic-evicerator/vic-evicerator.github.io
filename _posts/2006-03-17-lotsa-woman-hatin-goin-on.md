Musically, the *Misogyny 2* EP is finished. It'll be mailed off to Aerik tomorrow.

The *Misogyny 1* rerecording is finished, musically, but still needs mixing/production work. Still, that's going quickly as the recording process was pretty pain-free.

Next up - *Bellum Aeternum*...

*(I really need to figure out what to do about the misogyny in my older works...*

*That aside, this was a bit surprising to me, because Michael was born the next month, so I'm a bit surprised that I re-recorded the entire Bellum album in less than a month. Still, I have my studio log notebook so I went back and looked and, sure enough, it was only about 4 weeks. I recorded the first guitar tracks for Rainbow Skies on 3/16 and finished the last lead guitars, the solos in Nemesis and The Final Day, on 4/13. It's not super-duper amazing since all of this had been written and recorded before, and so I was just re-doing things I'd done before, but I had new takes on a few sections and I was doing the recording only an hour or two a night.*

*That's the focus I need to get back to.)*

We're in the last stages of mixing/production on the Websingle tracks. I expect we'll have this packaged and ready for distribution next week, maybe? Aerik's vocals have given these songs new life, and Andrew's excellent production/effects work has given these things a polish I could never dream of in my wildest fantasies with Bloody Leg Studios.

A few more release things have been shifted around, but more details on that as they get settled.

*(The comment thread noted that the mix would be done in a few days - by the 17th or 18th. Also, this was when Adrian "Commander" Keen invited me to do a call-in phone interview on his college radio show "Hell on Earth". If you have the UHR Sampler IV you have heard the interview, thanks to many kind souls who recorded the broadcast to mp3 and sent it to me. I love technology.)*

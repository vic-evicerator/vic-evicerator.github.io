And after one week, how much of my list did I get done?

- updating the ADR webstore with about a month's worth of new shit

But the Protoss and Zerg have been getting their ASSES KICKED!

Fortunately, we managed to dodge the storm, and the last round of repairs to fix the perpetual leak in our house seems to have worked - if we made it through the remnants of a Cat. 4 storm without a drop in the kitchen, I'd say it's a success. Except I've said it was a success three times before. So I guess I'll reserve judgement.

Also fortunately, I'm about to go off for a week-plus of fun-n-sun at Hilton Head with the family. Last year's trip was cut way too short, so it'll be nice to have a full week there this year - and I think the weather will be better this time around (at least I hope so - last time it WAS a hurricane...and the house leaked. Funny how history is a bunch of circles...).

Really, it's not quite so dire on the songwriting front. Misogyny II is about ready to get recorded, and now that the DB album is in the hands of Black Goat I finally cleaned off my recording PC hard drive to get ready for the wealth of new recordings I'm about to indulge in.

I also learned how to clean viruses/spyware off of a laptop. Don't ask.

So, at least the next semi-long absence will be explained. See you all later...

*(And while this post may seem at odds with my recollections at the end of the last post, keep in mind that in ONE week I did the biggest single task I ever had to do on a regular basis while also fixing a sick PC AND taking care of house repairs. Again, those disparate life threads weave together, and while only a little bit shows to certain people, only I see it all - but, if you look, you can see where threads from one area tug on other areas. I try to keep that in mind when looking at other people, not in a creepy way but in a 'hey, let's cut 'em some slack' kind of way.)*

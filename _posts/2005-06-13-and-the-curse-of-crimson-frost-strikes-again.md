Yep, it's pretty much official. Suffering Jesus has decided to pass on releasing *Devilution*, meaning that, once again, Crimson Frost seems destined for the vault rather than the store shelf. Any regular readers of Aerik's blog have seen most of the reasoning and his thoughts on it. I'm still deciding how to put mine, but more comments will come up later, that's for sure.

Also, some professional stuff in both my food-job and my music job have been keeping me from updating this. Some of the music stuff I just mentioned above. More will have to be discussed later, as there's still some developments that are up in the air.

On the plus side, I start recording *Misogyny II* in a week or two. Survive or perish.

We expect the Misantropical Painforest CDs back from the plant in about a week and a half, so stay tuned on that front.

For now, that is all.

*(That's one of the shoes dropping. I was so fucking pissed, and even though I'm happier now with the way UHR handled the release, I'm still mad about it. I still have the letter she sent us and my response to it, and I even have the AIM chat saved between Aerik and I where we discuss her flakiness. I'll have to update this post one day - and while it may smack of speaking ill of the dead, since it's the label that's dead and not a person my conscience would be clear.)*

We've started keeping a longer history of updates to let you see more easily what has been new over the past few months. Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the newest Barbarian Wrath releases are in, and the next batch should follow much more quickly. This is due to a new piece of news that it is finally time to share: The Alpha Draconis Records Webstore will continue to be a distributor of titles from Barbarian Wrath and Witches Brew.

Updated: September 2005

\* NEW ITEMS FROM BARBARIAN WRATH (GER): 
 o COUNTESS - Spawn of Steel CD - War themes and ancient tales of wrath and destruction abound on what could be Countess' finest album ever. Unremittingly ancient-styled while retaining the PURE ESSENCE of BLACK METAL. An absolute must! 
 o GRAVEWURM - Under the Banner of War CD - On their fourth assault, Gravewurm brings a tighter, more focused approach to the table. Brutally grim stuff - not for the weak. 
 o STINY PLAMENU - Zelezo Krvaci CD - Stiny Plamenu steps forward with a faster take on things and a more bizarre approach to riffing and songs.

\* NEW ITEMS FROM PARAGON RECORDS (US): 
 o CHARNEL VALLEY - The Dark Archives CD - While it is lo-fi raw black metal, it's skilled enough to stand apart from the pack. A good warm present sound that still preserves the rawness of this vicious assault and some uncommonly capable drumming and gruff vocals vaguely reminiscent of ChorazaiM (Megiddo) make this one worthwhile for those burned out on the 'blast-strum-shriek' variety of lo-fi BM. 
 o RIGOR SARDONICUS - Apocalypsis Damnare CD - Doom Gods Return! Slow-moving dirges of desolate funeral doom crush all in its path.

\* NEW ITEMS AND RESTOCKS FROM MORE HATE PRODUCTIONS (RUS): 
 o ASGUARD - Wikka CD - Second album of epic/viking thrashy heavy metal from this russian group, this time with more intense/technical guitar work. 
 o ASGUARD - Black Fireland CD - RESTOCK! Black Metal with heavy viking/epic influences and excellent guitar work 
 o PAGAN REIGN - Destiny of Ancient Fate CD - RESTOCK! Folk-tinged epic heavy/black metal. Choir chants and black metal vocals are used. Vaguely reminiscent of bands like Cruachan. Very well-played; recommended. 
 o PAGAN REIGN - Spark of Glory and Revival of Ancient Greatness CD - RESTOCK! More folk-influenced heavy/black metal from this Russian horde.

\* MORE NEW ITEMS FROM VARIOUS LABELS: 
 o GESTAPO 666 - Black Gestapo Metal CD - An odd mix of Hellhammer-type plodding with a slower form of the modern BM dissonance/strum melodies. Sick, disturbing imagery to boot. Features certain FBL-affiliated members as wellâ€¦ (Goatowarex) 
 o MORTHOND - Paths of Desolation CD - Very good desolate, atmospheric black metal - textured guitar work features prominently with very tasteful lead guitar and slight key use, vaguely comparable to Xasthur but quite distinct. Highly recommended. (Bindrune Recordings) 
 o SATANIC WARMASTER/GESTAPO 666 - split mCD - Crude and simplistic black metal demo compilation of some of both bands' earliest work. Only for the lo-fi lovers. (Niessedrion Records) 
 o WOLOK - Universal Void CD - Bizarre ambient and electronica blend with raw black metal ala the Black Legions. Unique and disturbing. (Northern Sky Productions)

To celebrate our continued distributor status with Barbarian Wrath, we are offering a special package deal - all three of the latest Barbarian Wrath albums (Countess "Spawn of Steel", Gravewurm "Under the Banner of War", and Stiny Plamenu "Zelezo Krvaci") for only $30 total - see the Specials Page for details and the order button.

*(Honestly, I'm surprised I didn't post updates like this more regularly on the blog - I guess I figured website and forum updates were enough. As for the items themselves, I honestly don't remember some of this stuff. I may need to check it out again.)*

Damn - nearly 3 weeks since the last entry, which was just a placeholder anyway.

Sorry, but between slow progress on working fronts and being sick there's nothing really new.

So, just letting everyone know I'm not dead. Yet. And hopefully many fruits will bear soon.

*(The 'previous entry' was some bullshit quiz post, nothing worth talking about. I don't remember what I was so busy with - except maybe mixing that Death Beast album? I'll have to figure this out...)*

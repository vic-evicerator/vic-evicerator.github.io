_(Housekeeping note - since I'm consolidating several blogs into my current one, I'm going back and reposting most of my old items just so it's all in one spot. So, everything italicized you see outside of parentheses or brackets is the original text.)_

Just signed up. I figure everyone else has a blog - why the f#@k not?

I'll post more BS here later. It's late.

_(Though I wonder sometimes why I bother. Still, it's interesting to think about. I certainly didn't write that thinking that I'd be going back nearly ten years later to revisit the post. But then we remember the weirdest things, both about others and about ourselves. How often do we go about our day doing normal things and think "hey, someone is going to remember this ten years from now" ? I know I don't...)_

That's right - the long-awaited "Ticket to Hell/Rampage" websingle is now out...

BUT

Only in mp3 format :(

I have a good, lossless FLAC version ready to go, but no way to share it as it's over 50MB and I don't have that kind of webspace or bandwidth. Bittorrent was my first choice, but it's become impossible to find a tracker, and I can't run one on my own (or maybe I could get someone to do it, but he's on vacation for another week :( ). May have to go the e-mule route, which I really don't want to do because it's too slow for downloading and that eats up time I could be working on my PC.

Fuck the RIAA.

Oh, if anyone was wondering, yes, Aerik did change all the lyrics, and yes, he did type them out - they're in the websingle listing on Rampage's entry of Metal-Archives.com

OH, and Black Sabbath fucking rules. These remasters rule beyond belief. They're like totally new albums.

*(Doing more digital releases like this wasn't in the cards quite the way I imagined it, but I like how now UHR has done almost fully digital through the Internet Archive. The ultimate goal was achieved, even though I didn't quite get there by the road I envisioned.*

*Also, another snapshot moment - cable modem wasn't quite as ubiquitous, so sharing had to account for slower speeds, hence the popularity of torrents and such. Now that online big-file-sharing disk space is so wide-spread and cheap, and people have much faster internet, we can just stream or download/upload with ease. "Oh, my, oh how the times have changed!")*

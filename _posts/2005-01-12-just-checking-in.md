Been rather busy with label work and such, and basking in the glory of the Websingle release which seems to be fairly well-received. I'm rather happy that my little experiment came off so well. Between mp3 and FLAC versions I moved about 50 of them in about 2-3 days - which is pretty damn good by underground standards.

*WHAT'S UP WITH CRIMSON FROST?* - Aerik will be recording vox on the last two tracks this weekend it seems, with previews available late next week, I think (but more on that in a second). Release probably won't be until February, though, because we're looking at doing something better than the hand-made CDR stuff, like maybe springing for pro-duplicated CDRs with full packaging. I just received a release that came like this a few weeks ago (thanks Axman!) and it was rather inspiring.

*WHAT'S AFTER CRIMSON FROST?* - two EPs and Letters from Hell. Probably in that order. Aerik and I have both decided we want LFH to be the DEFINITIVE Rampage album, showcasing the best we can do. That'll take a lot of work, which Aerik is almost done with his first share of. So, while we let that cook, we'll do the two EPs: we've pretty much decided that Misogyny... will get a sequel, and Aerik's given me a lot of lyrics for that already, and then of course the aborted split. This one won't really be thematic, just a collection of songs, probably showcasing a speedier side of us since most everything else we'll do would vaguely fall into doom.

Anything else? Yes - the Venom split I thought I was doing most likely won't happen as originally conceived, but will happen. I've just started recording bass tracks for Chemikiller, and I should be doing the production/mixing work on the Death Beast album pretty soon (Vocals are proceeding slowly but surely).

*(This post reminds me of two things that I knew happened but had forgotten the circumstances around - the cancellation of the Megiddo/Rampage split Venom tribute and the time I tried, unsuccesfully, to record bass for Chemikiller. Strangely, the resolution of each would come together with the Chemikiller/Rampage split tribute to Venom. Funny how life works sometimes.*

*Also, Letters From Hell comes up again, which now sadly looks like it will never happen under that particular conception. At least not as a Vic/Aerik partnership. I still feel like there's a future 'perfect' Rampage album out there somewhere, though, and one day sooner rather than later I'm going to start working on it.)*

1. After much hassle with DIY-type cover printing for UHR releases, I found a print house (or, rather, a print house found me) that will be able to do pro-level booklet and traycard printing, with low minimums and a cost that's a bit better than DIY. AND I won't have to cut/fold myself. Needless to say, this means UHR will take another upturn in quality (after our already-dramatic upturn since the move to pro-CDR duplication for the discs).

2. On the *Bellum Aeternum* mixing front, one of the big delays so far was that, for some reason, when any track would play back in the recording software it would get minor static, as if there were just shy of enough system resources to play it perfectly - not enough for a dropout, just enough for minor static glitches. However, I tested a particularly buggy track by exporting the mix, and the mix doesn't have the problems. This is good news; I feared that I might not have set a setting right, and thus would be doomed to have noisy mixes forever. As it turns out, it just means that I can't render stuff in real-time, but will have to mix offline. No big deal.

3. Just saw a blog entry Aerik made on the Rampage myspace page, dated Dec. 22, saying that Misogyny 2 is "in the works" and samples will be online "shortly".

I'm currently working on our "State of the Label" address for UHR, finishing my ADR Webstore physical inventory, and chipping away at that NY Resolutions list. More details as they become available.

*(Not much to add here, except to note for myself how long the mixing for Bellum Aeternum took. I still think I must do something with those tracks - but I'm not sure what.)*

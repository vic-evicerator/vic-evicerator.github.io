Thanks to the wonderful souls at The Trader's Den (http://www.thetradersden.org/) I have a tracker I can post torrents to, and so here it is, at long last, the FLAC version of Rampage's "Ticket to Hell" websingle. SPREAD THIS FUCKER LIKE THE PLAGUE!

*(The release of Crimson Frost on disc a year later made this superfluous, so this is more of a snapshot post thanks to the old Mindspring link and the reference to torrent-trading. Well, nobody said everything I repost had to be profound...)*

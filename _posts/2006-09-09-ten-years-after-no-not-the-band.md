I'm coming up on a lot of decade anniversaries now. Ten years ago was 1996, and some big things that were happening to and around me back then:

- The Olympic Games were in Atlanta 
- I graduated college 
- I got my job 
- I got married 
- I started Rampage

Some of these are being celebrated, of course. Work gives out little certificates and puts your name in the newsletter whenever you hit 'milestone' anniversaries (like 10 years on the job). My wife and I are planning something extra-special for our ten year anniversary. And so on.

And I plan on celebrating ten years of the current incarnation of Rampage. Now, if you have read the history, you know that what I mean by 'starting Rampage in its current incarnation in 1996' is that my friend Paul and I got together, turned on a boom box, and started writing or jamming songs that would end up on all of the Rampage discs you have in your hands right now. For that decade celebration, I'm thinking of somehow sharing some of these special recordings with you all, so that if you really want to hear what that very first version of Doomsayer or Doom Metal sounded like, you'll be able to hear it for yourself.

I've already missed the exactly-ten-year date of the "Blast from the Passed" session that started the whole ball rolling. That was the first time Paul and I did the jam session with 'drums', and marked the first time we wrote and played Kill Ya Tonite and DeadRot. Just about ten years ago right now is when our second session happened, when we worked out Wanderlust, The Last Hurrah (that became "The Wakening" on *Bellum Infinitum*), Doom Metal, and probably some more. I'll try to get these ripped and put in MP3, and thanks to my ISP I now have a pretty pain-free way to share these without sending huge-ass attachments on email or requiring filesharing clients.

If you're interested, let me know. I will ultimately need an email address to share the links for these songs, but don't leave the addy in the comments unless you want it bot-harvested by spammers. I'll contact you later about it.

*(The original post of this had zero comments. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. That's probably for the best, because I get in these 'archive, organize, and share my whole past' moods pretty often, and I still have the waves of the original tape dumps on my computer somewhere - still un-cut, unproduced, and untouched since I originally ripped them at about this time, which is ten years ago now as I write this addendum. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere too.*

*So, as it happens, I'm coming up on 20 years now. Any takers?)*

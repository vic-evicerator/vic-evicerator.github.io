How exactly do I reconcile \[this\] with \[this\]?

*(Modern note - the first \[this\] was a link to me 12/13 post about releasing CF, and the second was a link to Aerik's 12/22 post about not having the covers for CF done)*

It's like this - we were committed to the 12/13 release date, and I put the preorder link out there a day or two before. A lot of people ordered right off, and of course ordered a lot of other things. We honestly had plans to have the layout and duplication done by 12/13, but of course Murphy and his bitch Fate stepped in and fucked all that up.

So, to everyone who has ordered so far, I didn't want to hold your orders up so I went ahead and shipped the CDs with temporary covers, and we will mail you the final covers when they are done. Hopefully this shit will get done over the Solstice break here and we'll be able to mail those babies out next week.

Sorry for the mixup.

*(Another element of the release that I totally forgot about. It got resolved without much fuss or fanfare, though, I guess because not too many people ordered it right off the bat. That would come later.)*

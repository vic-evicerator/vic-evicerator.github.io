The Death Beast album The Wakening has been out for a couple of months now, and feedback is starting to come in. First reports, of course, were from board posters and emails from people who liked it - and far more did like it than didn't. I've heard some comments from an upcoming review in Diabolical Conquest that are very positive. Also, we just completed an interview for Tom Wren at Metal Nightmare, who said the album was good. It sort of justifies the three years it took to get it done. Hopefully the next one won't take quite so long.

More reviews are pending - at least one I know of for sure. I'll keep you posted.

*(I tie this album to 2005, of course, and September when it officially went out on BW's home shop, but by this time I'd been living with the album for a year. I forgot that it was this late that I started getting feedback - remember, despite the September release, I didn't get copies until November. It all seems so close together from ten years later, but at the time it seemed to take forever.)*

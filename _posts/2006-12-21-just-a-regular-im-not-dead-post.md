... and a bunch of musings about different stuff.

- My affinity for Dire Straits has just been fed again. I got ANOTHER great gig from the Making Movies tour, this one from Boston on 11/16/80. This is just a couple of days after the New York gig I mentioned below, which was itself just a couple of days after the "Emerald City" gig in Philadelphia.

- Tower Records has been having great clearance sales since the entire company is going belly-up. A few days ago I went on a whim. Regular clearance prices were 40% off everything, but the day I went they were giving an extra 20% off of all CDs and music DVDs. I scored:

--Voi Vod - *War and Pain* (the two-case, three-disc super-mondo edition) 
--UFO - *Phenomenon* 
--Venom - *Metal Black* 
--World Party - *Private Revolution* 
--The Stooges - *Raw Power* (slipcase reissue, remastered)

And it only ran me right about $40. Schweeeeeet!!

- Still working on *Bellum Aeternum*. Mixing is going slow, since I'm still in the cleanup phase. I left a LOT of double-take tracks on there, and choosing which takes to go with, which ones I intended to keep and which to use for splicing out mistakes, is taxing. I kept a recording journal notebook during the recording process, but even the notes there aren't much help. Well, it's slow progress, but it IS progress.

- Due to spread-out family, I've got half my x-mas presents already. A Best Buy gift card for music, a Circuit City gift card for more music, and a couple of music DVDs - John Fogerty "The Long Road Home" and KISS' "Kissology, Vol. 1". No time to watch any yet. What I REALLY need is a DVD drive for my laptop so I can watch this shit at work during my lunch breaks....

I could go on regaling you with tales of me rearranging my CD shelves, or how my other blog got a facelift thanks to the programmers at Blogger.com, but I'd rather not bore you all.

... any more than I already have, I mean.

*(I'm so happy about this, but I should be lamenting it. Coming from a small(ish) town, we didn't have huge music outlets - Camelot Music in the local mall was the only, pathetically-mainstream-oriented music seller I had in my formative years, so when I got to Atlanta and college my brother showed me the way to Tower Music, and then I found Wuxtry, Wax-n-Facts, and all of the other great, big, and small holes-in-the-walls fixes for my musical joneses. I spent hundreds of dollars in Tower over the years, bringing me hours and hours of pleasure and plenty of fodder for thought, if not direct musical inspiration. There's a blog post here waiting to be written, so I'd probably best leave this one here for now.*

*Lots of other chains closed in the wake of this, so for a while I made out like a bandit, but now I'm stuck - yes, you can find anything online, but it's not like walking into a shop, going up to a bin and not knowing what the hell you will find - and by 'find' I mean hold in your hands, and see with nothing but a couple of feet of air between you and the disc/album in question. Something was lost, that's for sure.*

*But hey, cheap discs!)*

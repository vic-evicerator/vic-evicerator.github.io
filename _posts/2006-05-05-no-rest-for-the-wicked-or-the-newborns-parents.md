Things are great, mostly, but with a few shitty things. Our new son was born last week. Despite the thread title, he's actually letting us get a somewhat decent amount of rest, so I actually have time to make progress on all of the non-Rampage musical work I had set myself to do over the next couple of months.

But my fucking computer is dead. My main home desktop, that is. Thankfully my laptop is okay (DAMN, I said it... oops....), but a lot of my work is stymied until I can figure out WHAT is going on and fix it.

To a few people I'm doing business with for UHR and ADR - I owe some of you e-mails. You will get them shortly. And Commander Keen - I have your FTP info set up, so hopefully we can get the Demontage show on the road real fuckin' soon - this album SHREDS!

Oh yeah, and an almost-belated HAPPY NATIONAL DAY OF REASON:

*(I'll have to doublecheck my history timelines, but I think this was when I was preparing to release the first Demontage album, "Sacrilege 'n' Miscreancy" on UHR. I think I released the Black Torment album "Obscurum II" at the same time. Interesting that I could still keep things going, even with a dead desktop.)*

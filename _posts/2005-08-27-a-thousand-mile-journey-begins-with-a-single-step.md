... but it's hard to take one step when you've still got 4,999,999 to go after that. It gets so big one says 'why bother? I'll just watch shitty reruns on TV, because at least that way I don't have to move.'

Well, to be honest, TV isn't anywhere near the problem that, say, video games are, but the point is still valid. I've got tons of shit I need to do and no motivation - because it's just so much I'll never get it done. When your free time only comes in 20 minute blocks and you have hour-long chores, it becomes way too easy to spend 20 minutes on blasting the Protoss and the Zerg - a 20 minutes you feel guilty about later because you end up playing over by an hour which you REALLY COULD HAVE USED.

I suck at that kind of thing, because I've always had a weak spot for video games. But I'm trying.

Shit to expect:

- finishing up blog series' on Rampage songwriting and the Black Sabbath/anti-christian-'metal' screeds 
- updating the UHR page with news about that 
- updating the ADR webstore with about a month's worth of new shit 
- finishing the writing of Misogyny II 
- record Misogyny II 
- finish tweaking Bellum Aeternum 
- record Bellum Aeternum 
- make a couple of long-overdue news announcements

In the meantime, to help out, go to http://www.alphadraconisrecords.org/ (Dead Link) and buy something.

*(Ah, Starcraft... that's right, now that I remember from a post a couple of months before this, this was when I had my first weak laptop, and the Blizzard games were about all it could handle. I played the shit out of Diablo II as well. I really did get a lot of work done, because I distinctly remember taking my laptop down to our building's atrium/lobby during lunch to write blog posts, or program drums, or update webpages, or send trade emails... And, unlike future 'accountability' posts like this one, I did actually manage to finish everything on that list within a month or two of posting this one. Or at least most of everything.)*

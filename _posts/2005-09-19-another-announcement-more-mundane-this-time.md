No big secrets, just clarifying on one thing I mentioned earlier. The Alpha Draconis Records Webstore will continue in the future to be a distributor of Barbarian Wrath titles. See, Black Goat (BG) has, like all of us, the limitation of time - we only have so much of it and enough stuff to do to use up at least three times that much time. So, you have to pick and choose what gets done, and oftentimes what determines what you choose is, in some way or other, a cost/benefit analysis - doing this takes X time but is of value A to me, and if X is too high then A is too low and it's not worth doing. While BG's satellites did help immensely in exposure, they took a lot of time in extra bookkeeping because they weren't traditional distros which buy/trade up-front. It's a smarter business model that involves less money out of pocket for satellites and home base alike, but the time investment is in keeping the books straight and being, well, German about keeping track of sales, money, etc.

For a while, it was worth it. Then, as time dwindled, I assume it just got to the point where it wasn't worth BGs time investment.

Now, though, that ADR is set up as a separate store, and we are doing business in a more straightforward less time-intensive method, things are okay to go again as far as ADR stocking BW and WB titles. Also, it seems I won't have to raise my prices as I feared earlier.

Look for ADR to reopen this week, and either late this week or next week we'll finally get in the box of the early-summer BW releases (Countess "Spawn of Steel", Stiny Plamenu "Zelezo Krvaci", and Gravewurm "Under the Banner of War").

*(I don't have much to add here - except that I don't remember our arrangement being that different. Maybe it was just simpler because most of my trades with other distros were coming directly to us, rather than through BG. I ought to go back through my old bookkeeping excel files and see what I remember about all of this.)*

Over the past week and a half I've managed to complete the recording for *Misogyny 2* and finish the rhythm guitars on the *Misogyny 1* rerecording.

I'd have had the bass on Mis-2 done except that, after finishing all the tracks, I realized when doing the post-production that my bass tone was total shit. As in un-salvageable. So I gotta recut it all. But that's okay, since I can knock out the bass on Mis-1 the same day, then just top off the leads for Mis-1. I even have M-2's drums already spun out. Aerik will be screaming his lungs out very shortly.

In general, things will stay this hectic until I finish all this recording stuff, about mid-April. Then the new kid will keep me busy for the next six months or so. UHR and ADR are both temporarily on hold, since it's easier to make time for that kind of stuff at work, and for now I need to focus on the music side while I still can.

Still, I've got at least four releases already set up to go on UHR come May-June, and if all goes well at least four more will get ready by then. Then I can dole them out over the rest of 2006 until it comes to studio time for my next two big projects: *The Onslaught* and *Letters from Hell*.

*(The plan described above was set about four or five months before this, so it's interesting to see that I was sticking to it. Nothing like a hard deadline to force some work. Maybe there's a lesson for my present-day predicament...*

*Anyway, the pride in the above is tempered by the last paragraph, where I mention one project currently in drydock awaiting massive patching and repairs and another project dead in the water. I really must talk about LFH some day. Hell, maybe we can even get it done? Nah, fate would never be THAT kind...)*

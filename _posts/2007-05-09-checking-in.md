Yes, I'm still alive.

No, *Bellum* is not done. But it's damn close.

And so's something else... To complete the migration to my new PC I have to finish mixing down all of the audio projects I recorded on the old one. After much work, that's only Bellum right now, and that's close to done. Or so I thought.

As I was compiling notes for the upcoming Breath of the Dragon newsletter (Sorry April didn't work out, but we have lots of stuff for the May issue...) I went through my UHR news updates and realized that I had stopped talking about a project I planned quite a while ago - the Death Beast demo collection. I wanted to compile all the work that Dementor, Axe and I did on that first demo plus the few tracks that Ramrod/Juggernaut did for us, plus I had found a couple that I did some test vocalizations on (terrible, really, but there they are....). Well, I seemed to remember that I did get some final vocal mixes of Juggernaut, but only one would work synchronization-wise. So, I went digging, and found it: HCTW\_ryan\_vox.cwb - yes, Ramrod doing vocals on the nearly-final version of "Here Comes the War". I totally forgot about this track. It was just buried among some other 'random' tracks and scratch tapes.

So, I gave it a listen. It seems to be an earlier drum take, but it has the final guitar and bass tracks, and Ramrod's excellent vocals. It EVEN has an alternate ending - a different sample bit that's funnier (which is probably why we didn't use it - it was just too 'happy' or upbeat for what's supposed to be a menacing album).

And the final upshot is that converting the archive .cwb file to a mixed-down wave file was child's play. Another project put to bed. I'm so happy.

*(You always hear big-time musicians talk about tracks unearthed from 'The Vaults', and the word connotation and the reverence with which it's always uttered when they talk about 'unearthing' tracks from 'The Vault' - you can actually hear the capital letters - always make it sound like some big, grand, deliberate thing. "We've recorded fifteen songs, but only ten are going on the album. Two we'll save for B-sides. The other three will go into...(dramatic pause)... \*\*\*THE\*VAULT\*\*\*" \[dramatic musical stab\].*

*In reality, I'm sure it's just like this story here - mis-named or mis-labeled stuff that gets shunted off to some 'sort\_this\_later' folder on your desktop to be forgotten until you decide 'hey, I need more disk space, but I really better check this folder before I just trash the whole thing...'.*

*It's not as dramatic, but I find reality a bit more charming. Who knows what other presents I've left myself on this old thing. I've got about 100 GB of shit on this beast I still have to sort...)*

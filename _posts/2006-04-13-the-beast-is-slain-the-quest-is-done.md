Or almost, anyway. EVERYTHING FOR *BELLUM AETERNUM* IS RECORDED!

Not that the entire album is finished, of course. To save the maximum time for recording I put off a lot of the recording-process cleanup work, like cleaning up the splices, trimming out noise, deciding on multiple takes, that sort of thing. Since editing can be done piecemeal, it can be done in-between rugrat play sessions, midnight feedings, during naps... so it will be a while before even Aerik can get his hands on it, much less any of you can hear it.

But my goal, to have the recording finished before little Vic #2 gets here, has been met.

And while my recording tales are nothing like the drinking/carousing/bar fights/bitchfests with the producer/label idiots tales that many more populous bands can tell, I did make mental (and pencil) note of a few things that I will eventually share that may be of some interest to the budding home/DIY musician.

*(Ah, such naive words - little did I know that within four weeks the PC this was on would blow up and all of these recordings would be in jeopardy of permanent death.*

*At least I had a plan.)*

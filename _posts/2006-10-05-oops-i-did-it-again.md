I let this blog go nearly a month without an update.

Which should really just be a sign of how busy I am. Too bad nothing is getting done.

That's not entirely true - it's just homelife on the front burner, and so many of my other musical projects are waiting on input from others:

- Alpha Draconis Records is set to release the next Vrolok albums (Resurgence III new CD and Resurgence I reissue), but we're waiting on the masters.

- UHR is set to release the Hellgoat/Panzerfaust split, but we're waiting on the masters. Also, the Chemikiller/Rampage Venom tribute is kinda ready to go, but needs artwork (which is my fault, so I probably shouldn't have mentioned it....)

- Aerik has a couple of Rampage releases to vocalize, and when I finally finish resurrecting my once-dead studio PC he'll have a third.

- Finally, I was starting a newsletter for all UHR and ADR artists, but I'm waiting on info submissions from the UHR and ADR artists.

If you're one of the people I've referred to above, please understand I'm not bitching. The way life is right now it would only hit more delays once it gets to my inbox anyway. Or maybe this is Karma payback for all the delays I gave others when I DID have time to get shit done.

Anyway, yes, I'm alive, the above is what is coming soon, and if I don't see you all before then have a great Halloween. :)

(As for the blog, my other one is getting more updates lately, and has plenty of Car Decoration Idiocy and Tractmania in the pipes. This one was in danger of becoming a Dire-Straits-review blog, so I have to go through my musical history again. You know, now that I mention it, I never did 'writing-of' posts for the Death Beast songs...)

*(It's a good thing that old blog I mention above went away. I go back to remember some of my posts and it's just cranky old rantings. Not that the targets didn't deserve it, but, well... I know I gripe about time I wasted playing games back then -- okay, and now... -- but that at least was enjoyable time. It wasn't the greatest waste in time, amount-wise, but just spending any time on spites that were ultimately so petty... There's another lesson in there for me somewhere, but it's one I've been working on taking to heart for quite some time now.*

*What, a sensitive metalhead? I guess the apologist would say they're cranky because they're mad at injustices... yeah, that'll work. For now, I guess.)*

The new PC: I finally got my motherboard ordered. Should be here early next week. If the rest of our tax refund gets here tomorrow, I'm shopping-spreeing all weekend.

The old PC - to wit, cleaning it off: Today I did a lot of trimming and mixing, and came out with rough mixes of half of Bellum Aeternum. Even without effects this is sounding damn good. Really. I'm surprised. I could use a better MIDI sound generator, as the piano and flute stuff on "Up from the Depths" sounts a bit chintzy. Not sure if there's just a better sound bank for the EDIROL VSC or if I have to go with a completely different software synth. I'll try that later. The main thing is just getting the audio trimmed and mixed first.

Also, I'll have another 'help with' audio article like my last one on EQ soon. This one: Panning.

*(This is a bit of news to me. I forgot that I tried to do final mixes on the old PC. The EDIROL VSC is barely better than a $50 toy Casio keyboard, sound-wise, but here I was giving it a go. I'm sure that was just for the synths, though, because I remember distinctly that the DR-008 was bundled with Sonar 2 - that's why I was surprised when it wasn't in Sonar 6 and thus why I had to buy a standalone disc of it a few months after this original post. I wonder if I have any of the old cassette sub-mixes of this?)*

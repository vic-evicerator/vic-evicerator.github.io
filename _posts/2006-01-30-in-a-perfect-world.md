In a perfect world, no news in a long time from a musician would mean they're working on new music.

Well, this world may not be perfect, but it's getting there. Rather than give the empty-sounding promises of 'soon...' that I usually do, I will say that Fucked Raw is almost done and Misogyny 2 is lagging just behind.

I'm not as far on this end of things because Death Beast has been keeping me busy lately. Though our last suck-ass wimp of a 'bassist' chickened out on us, we managed to pull the photo shoot off anyway and the results are now posted on the freshly-updated Death Beast site here:

What's more is that we also just completed another interview, this one with Herr Wilhelm at Dark Recollections Zine.

On the Rampage side of things, vorfeed (http://www.vorfeed.net/) just reviewed Rampage's "Crimson Frost", and the comments were all-around quite positive. We've sent promos of this (and the Death Beast) to a few more people so I expect more reviews shortly (and hope for interviews - we'll see I guess).

Also, to indulge in my (vain?) hope that people love reading what I write, as well as to satisfy that virtual exhibitionist streak most bloggers have, I decided to start a personal blog. If you actually care to read it, go below the fold.

Nothing earth-shattering there yet - I've just started. All you metal people looking for more metal stuff to read will probably be sorely disappointed, unless you get a thrill at how we metal gods are really just normal people, and probably less interesting than some of you. Then again, maybe you find the study in contrasts fascinating - I know I would, if I ever had the opportunity to peruse the personal blog of any of my metal gods.

Plus, this way, I won't pollute this blog with all the stuff about, say, my brother's surprise wedding last weekend or my second son who will be here in April. How could you reconcile cutesy stuff like that with the drunken boor at the top of this page, hm?

*(The vorfeed link is still alive. The Death Beast page still needs updating, including new pictures - those are now outdated, though they've been used semi-recently. Oddly, the lordvic blogspot link is recursive now - that's the blog I'm currently {in July 2014} closing down and migrating back to here.*

*That blog itself has a storied history. It started as personal thoughts and bullshit, then turned into religious/philosophical argumentation, then I stripped it down to nothing, burned it all, and recast it as a music blog - that ended up with only about a dozen posts over four or five years. But, if you've been reading me for any length of time, you know that's how I roll.*

*By August 2014 all of that blog's posts should be here, between 2009 and 2014 - check it out. )*

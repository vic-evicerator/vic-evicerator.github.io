Not one but TWO preview tracks of upcoming Rampage releases:

http://media.audiostreet.net/D223BAB03D1243428B2BECDA64EAB9BC/Download/lucifer\_\_our\_father\_\_rough\_mix\_.mp3 (Dead Link)

The first is "Ticket to Hell" from the upcoming websingle. This baby will ONLY be available via share networks, downloading, and G-Mail.

Second is a rough (Not final) mix of "Lucifer, Our Father" from Crimson Frost. If you think those sound like real drums, that's because they are - with Toby Chappell being the man behind the kit. This gives you a good idea of what most of Crimson Frost will sound like. (Two more covers are in the hopper, but they'll be traditional me-with-my-drum-sequencer covers...)

*(Again, those Audiostreet links hang out there like bad school pictures, except these pictures were pretty cool. Interesting to see I was still planning on doing those two covers. I wonder exactly why I decided to pass on them? Maybe I'll find it in all of this reposting.)*

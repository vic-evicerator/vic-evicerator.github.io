Still taking it in and formulating thoughts for a full review, which will come later.

The show I'm referring to, of course, was last night's Hellgoat/Quinta Essentia/Eyes of Ligeia gig at the Masquerade (in Hell). It was the CD release party for Hellgoat and Eyes of Ligeia's first ever live appearance. A good time was had by all. EoL just had two members on stage, Toby on guitar/vox and Amon from Hellgoat on drums, but the sound was massive. Quinta Essentia were technical wizardry, and Hellgoat was unadulterated raw blasphemy, complete with blood, a desecrated bible, and plenty of offended little christian hardcore kiddies there to see the pop-punk christer rockstars who were playing in Heaven.

I also got to meet Jim from Paragon Records and hung out with Evan from Deathgasm Records. A good time was had by all.

*(That was a great day as well - it was a Thursday, so it was a workday for me, though Toby had taken the day off. Jim from Paragon Records flew down to see the show, so he and Toby picked me up from my office that day for lunch. We went to the Vortex in Midtown Atlanta and had burgers, and then I went back to work while they went to hang out and get ready for the show. That one lunch sticks in my mind for some reason.)*

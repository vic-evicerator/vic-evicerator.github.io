Bar none.

I thought KISS knew how to do an arena show...

Even my memory of Judas Priest on the Painkiller tour doesn't come close to matching what I just got through seeing. The windmill drumming of Scott Travis. The relentless pumping and headbanging from Ian Hill. The surgical precision of Glenn Tipton. KK Downing, working the crowd, looking like some leather-clad warrior. And Rob Halford, totally fucking dominating the stage, the entire crowd eating out of his hand when they weren't holding their ears in a vain attempt to shield themselves from his literally ear-piercing screams.

"Fucking amazing" doesn't even come close.

I'll post more after I digest it all. I'm in shock. And can die happy.

*(I saw them a few years later, on the British Steel Anniversary tour, but this 2005 show was the best. Fucking amazing.)*

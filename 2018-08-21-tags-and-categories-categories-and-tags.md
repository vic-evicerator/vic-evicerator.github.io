One nice thing about the numerous blog migrations is that I've been doing one of my favorite things - dancing down Memory Lane, re-remembering all kinds of things I thought I forgot. Funny how powerful words can be.

Of course, sometimes something nice ends up becoming a chore, though I'm trying not to let it be: Categories and Tags.

See, Livejournal used to use 'moods' and 'music', new database fields I can't add in on a free install ("Upgrade to PRO..."), and for some reason all of the old tags I had on the old posts didn't come out when exporting from LJ, so I'm having to go back and add in all of the tags. Or categories.

And yes, there's a difference - and given that my food job ends up making me think about the differences between things like this, I keep having to make calls: "Should this be a category or a tag? What's even the difference between them? Is anyone even going to give a shit?"

Well, it's this or Fallout 4. So why not try to do something that will at least entertain a few others.

Nothing's completed yet (200-something posts is a lot to go through), but I roughly have a system set up - Categories for News (past and present - and all present ends up becoming past, so I guess I mean 'news when I originally wrote it'), History ("sit down, son, let me tell you a story about the bad ol' days..."), Songs (where I go in-depth into song meanings, how I wrote them - a targeted history, if you will), Meta (bullshit about blog housecleaning and such - like this very post), and the perennial 'Uncategorized', which is kinda like that one drawer in your kitchen that has all of the odd tools you don't know where to put, but you can't throw out even though you haven't used it in years because the second you pitch it you know you'll need it...

And no, I'm NOT speaking from experience here...

Tags are for the specifics - the labels (ADR, UHR, Barbarian Wrath), the bands (Rampage, Death Beast, others...?), or the albums (Bellum, Monolith, The Wakening...).

One improvement over LJ - back then, I had to make a post and update it to include all of the tag listings. Now I think I can just put a widget in the sidebar. More info as I figure it out.

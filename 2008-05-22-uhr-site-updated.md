Yes, many years too late, I finally added a dedicated page to the UHR site for links to audio samples. A couple of direct MP3 links are there, but most are links to sound-loaded websites (Audiostreet, Myspace, etc.)

Enjoy. More stuff coming soon (I was just working on layouts earlier today as a matter of fact...)

*(I remember building this sample page, trying to make a more robust online presence - and I remember it so well because that was the page I stripped to the bones and recoded when I moved, again, to the Internet Archive for posting music online. I still have some work to do getting more stuff uploaded, but at least it's progress, of a sort.)*

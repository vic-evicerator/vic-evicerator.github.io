In previous years I always put up some kind of a "New Year's Resolution" post explaining what I planned to get accomplished that year - putting semi-reasonable goals of getting X, Y, and Z done before the next 365 days are up.

And I usually failed.

This year I didn't do that, but for some reason after the xmas holidays, with the extra time and buoyed by the recent relaxation I started getting done a lot of shit I'd been meaning to do. So, I'm not resolving anything, but just telling you all (all 3 of you) what I've been up to.

1) Ever since the demise (let's not bullshit ourselves) of UHR I've been wanting to revitalize it in some way. Influenced by some life-changing moves of a friend and co-conspirator of mine, and thinking about how to keep evolving the label along with the evolution of what music has become in the face of the Internet, I've been trying to convert UHR to a digital-only online netlabel. This involves getting properly indexed archives of everything I've released set up and organized, and then going through the bits that I have rights to and aren't cover songs and uploading them to the Internet Archive, thus transitioning UHR completely to a netlabel.

Well, I'm about 90% done with the musical file organization. I have to arrange proper graphics files to go with these, so that I have a removable hard drive that contains the totality of UHR's output. Then I plan to make a copy and share with a friend off-site so that I have a proper backup plan. Second, I plan to go through what I am okay with uploading and do it, and for the parts that I'm not I will secure the rights or permission if I can.

2) Just this week I've finally got all of the Rampage recordings I completed in 2006 into Aerik's hands so that he can finish them off and we can see about finally getting some new Rampage out there.

3) I finally completed the re-assembly and mixing of Death Beast's live gig from a couple of months ago after the horrendous nightmare of the gig itself and its aftermath. That will see some kind of release soon. A few samples are on Death Beast's Facebook page - http://listn.to/deathbeast (Dead Link)

4) As some of you may have seen by now, Death Beast is now label-less, as Black Goat has decided to call it a day with Barbarian Wrath. I will not let this mean the end of Death Beast, and so we will most likely just move over to UHR for the release of our next album *The Onslaught*.

5) Speaking of which, I'll be honest, *The Onslaught* only has 3 finished songs now, but I'm working on more. Slowly, but working on it. It's not like setting hard deadlines has gotten me anywhere in past years, so let's see what a softer approach yields.

I think that's enough for now. Let's see what goes on from here.

*(This was a much healthier documentation of what I did and didn't get done over the past year, and it shows in what I actually DID get done - the Death Beast live album and beginning the UHR Internet Archive page. Also, as you all know now, Black Goat/Opyros did not end BW, so we still have a label - and he's still waiting on my album, I know, but I'm making real progress now, even if it is two years or so late. Or eight, depending on when you count it.)*

That's right. Not 'a' holiday. [THE Holiday.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Holiday)

But at least I'm not [sick like last time.](2005-07-08-where-does-the-time-go.md)

So, if anyone wonders where I am the next week and why the UHR stuff (which I'm still behind on) is running farther behind, there you go.

Anyone know any good driving games to play while driving across backwater holes like Alabama?

*(Rather than apologize again for not being busier with music, I'll note that the link above is different from the first time I posted it - because in all of the years since then, which honestly hasn't been too many years in the grand scheme of things, "The Holiday" was sold to a Portuguese cruise line and is now the "Grand Holiday" for another company. I would say it's weird that things change, but what would really be weird is if they didn't. It's like driving through your childhood neighborhood as an adult - yes, you grew, it didn't shrink, but there are new buildings, bigger trees, more cracks in the pavement...*

*Or, in this case, a new flag on the pole.)*

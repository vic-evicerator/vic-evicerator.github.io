Check the catalog periodically over the next couple of weeks for updates - as trades come in we will be adding new items, so check back in often. Also, note the price cuts on all items.

*(That was always the way it worked - quick return on the discs (late August to Sept. 5), but then a long time to complete the online posting (Sept. 5 to Sept. 21). I guess it's both good and bad that some things never change...)*

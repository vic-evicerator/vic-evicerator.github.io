After a long and uneventful absence, I am back here.

I've said it before, many times, so you have no reason to believe this will be any different, but this blog will come back to life as I document my musical life both going forward and looking back.

Look for not only more new posts, but also some transplanted posts from my abortive attempt to get music blogging going on my Blogspot blog. While I have some good content there, and I like the appearance, it's the features of LiveJournal that are bringing me back.

*(Well, I THOUGHT this was the end of history, but as is usual with myself - if I have discovered nothing else about myself after reviewing five years of my life in just a couple of months - it takes me a while to really commit to doing something, even if it's something I really want. As the next post shows, I keep rethinking things, letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. So, if a few 'no, I'm really back' posts and waffling over which actual physical blog to put it on is the price I pay for actually being back, okay.*

*As this shows, it's okay to do it badly and fix or improve it later. It beats the shit out of doing nothing while telling yourself you're really working.*

*Yes, that's me talking to myself, not just you. Maybe I'll listen this time...)*

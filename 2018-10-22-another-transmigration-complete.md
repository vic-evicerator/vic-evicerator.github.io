Yep, I've finally completed yet another transmigration. Now that this blog is fully implemented on the 000-webhost site, I've also finished going through the whole blog and updating all of the categories and tags. There are still some wrong links and missing images and I'll have to figure that stuff out - combined with deciding whether to go with an old web-style image hosting or go with one of the things the kids are using nowadays - Imgur, Instagram, Flickr - what ARE they using nowadays?

And to avoid the risk of this being all about housekeeping, I've also got a monster post in the works that will likely get broken up - a "Then and Now" kind of thing, actually. October 2018 may well see the release of Death Beast *The Onslaught*, which is actually a nice bit of serendipity since it is also the 20th anniversary of the release of my first proper solo full-length album, Rampage's first full length *This End Up*. I've done a deep dive into that album already, song by song, and I've been working on those for Death Beast (and Festering Sore) as well, but I don't think I've ever really addressed at length the whole recording process. Those are special times in my life, even though they didn't really seem like it at the time. Chuck Schuldiner was more right than he knew with the song "Symbolic"...

So, hopefully, more to come soon, and not just meta-bullshitting like this.

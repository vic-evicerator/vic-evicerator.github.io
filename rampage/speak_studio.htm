Ah, the power of technology - able to put an entire industry out of business.
</P><P>
I'm speaking, of course, about the studio industry and its incestuous ties to 
the corporate (cocksucker) music biz.  It used to be you had to either submit
to their technological extortion or suffer through clunky, lo-fi four-track
jobs at home.  But thanks to the technology explosion, you can get very nice
tape-based machines or digital 'studio-in-a-box' machines for a reasonable
amount of cash, or if you know what you're looking for you can try the home-computer
software route - just a few bucks (or having friends in CDR circles or the right
share software) can get you something with the power that puts old studios to
shame.  The Doors' debut album in a pro studio on a 4-track?  Sabbath's debut
on an 8-track?  Fuck that - with even a modest P-933 and a soundcard under a 
hundred bucks, you can have a computer-based studio that puts those old studio
setups to shame.
</P><P>
All provided, of course, you know what you're doing.  Or 
are willing to endure LOTS AND LOTS of Trial and Error.
</P><P>
Or if you know someone who's already blazed the trail, marking out all the
pitfalls for you to avoid.
</P><P>
When I first knew I was striking out on my own, in 1997, I thought I'd be forced to
go the usual route - drum machine, four-track tape machine, and a helluvalot of bouncing
tracks and such.  I was shopping and pricing both of them, keeping an eye out towards
some kind of software that would allow me to use the computer to drive the drum machine
via MIDI (program on the PC, play through the drum machine and record that onto the
4-track).  In shopping around I did find a drum program (Drumz Wizard, but that's another
whole article...), but also found something else: MAGIX MUSIC STUDIO 3.0.  It purported
itself to be a complete studio, allowing you to program MIDI and record digital audio, 
mix it all down, and make your own music.  "Turn your PC into a music studio!", it said.
</P><P>
I was also unhappy with the stock soundcard in that old computer (a Hewlett-Packard P-166),
so I got a SoundBlaster AWE64 (I know, I know... but at the time it was the best there was
that I could afford) - it had not only a good-sounding input, it had an onboard MIDI
synth including SoundFont/Wavetable Samples - that meant the drum sounds were triggering
wave files of REAL DRUMS.  Also necessary were a few bucks' worth of connectors/converters from
Radio Shack to allow me to plug 1/4" instrument cables into the stereo 1/8" input on
the soundcard.  And about $30 for a half-decent microphone and cable for vocals.
</P><P>
So, for the total cost of about $150, I had a decent-quality soundcard, up to 8 tracks of 
digital audio and 128 tracks of MIDI, a drum sequencer, good drum samples, and thanks to 
a friend, SoundForge for digital editing and effects.  Of course, this setup was not 
without its quirks:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Wavetable synthesis not only used the MIDI out port, it also used the Audio out port.
This was in the days before DirectSound, so you couldn't have two audio devices playing
at the same time - which meant you had to render the drums externally somehow and record
them in a wave file, then turn off the MIDI to record the rest.</LI>
<LI>My soundcard mixer software didn't work right (or I didn't know how to work it right),
so I had to 'record' drums by connecting the soundcard out back to the soundcard in using
a physical cable and play the drum software to record it.</LI>
<LI>My old machine was only a first-generation Pentium 166MHz, with only a 2.5 GB hard
drive.  And I also used that machine to play lots of games (DOOM most notably) - hard drive
space was at a minimum, and with such little in the way of processor overhead I had to
trim down and record in a lower quality.  CD quality is 16 bit, 44.1 KHz sampling - I cut
that in half to 16 bit 22 KHz sampling, meaning I was only eating up 2.5 MB/minute
of recording time.  (Remember, that's PER MONO TRACK - stereo drums+bass+two guitars+leads
equals 15MB/minute, per song.)</LI>
<LI>Magix, being an old Windows 3.1-based 16-bit program, had its own quirks, like not
being able to support Windows long filenames (8.3 only), only supporting 255-bar patterns
(any MIDI clip longer than 255 bars would start 'ghosting' on the display - bar 1 would
also show the notes in bar 256, etc.), etc. etc. etc.</LI>
<LI>You couldn't mix down directly out of Magix - 'mixing' down literally meant
connecting the soundcard-out to a cable to run to the stereo tape deck (or DAT machine, 
which I didn't own...), and doing the old "Play-Record, stop-stop" method of recording
to cassette, then re-digitizing the cassette to make the CDR master.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Still, I persevered, and under these deplorable conditions managed to record
the "Misogyny" EP, "This End Up", the "Doom Metal" single, and also the tracks for the Live
album.  The live album was a step up because on that one I actually tried the drums in
stereo instead of just in mono.  It worked out well without causing any dropouts or
glitches in recording stereo tracks, which I was afraid of because it was doubling the
input.
</P><P>
Right after that I started working on "Bellum Infinitum", and that's when I made the first
big leap forward from my starting point.  There were some songs that had keyboard parts, 
and I was worried about how to sync them up with the drums and other external audio.
Somehow I got the great idea to try importing the drum tracks I normally do directly into
Magix and use MAGIX to play and record the drums instead of playing them on that crappy
Drumz Wizard program.  I tried it and it worked, thus solving my synchronization problem
but giving me the additional problem of having to learn how to use the drum editor of
a whole new program.  Fortunately, that ended up being a plus, because instead of just
knowing how to loop patterns I really learned how to use MIDI, which gave me many more
applications than just drums.  The mixdown for Bellum was pretty easy, once I figured out
that I had to render drums to wave, and then go back and set the MIDI output to my soundcard
MIDI synth for doing the keys and such.
</P><P>
That improvement set me to trying to find a better way to render drums, because using one
program to simply play and record meant I had to render in realtime and suffer dropout
risk and latency issues (The intro to "The Vow" sounds a bit out of time because
of this).  I started looking around and experimenting, and found out about a program
called "WaveMaker" that takes a MIDI file and runs it against a patch-sample bank to
render it to a perfectly-timed Wave file.  After hacking the INI file for it I found out
how to map it to my own samples, and then after digging for a good drum set I ripped
out the three tracks for the Hellhammer tribute.
</P>

<P>
Rendering drums offline was such a refreshing change that I started looking for a new
way to possibly render my full mixes offline as well.  After some discussion with another
user, I discovered the wonders and power of Cakewalk 7.  I wasn't looking forward to learning
another program, but the power of being able to export mixes directly to wave without
touching tape was very intriguing.  Right about that time I
had also gotten a new computer, a Dell P-III 933 MHz machine with 256 MB RAM and a 20 GB 
hard drive.  Magix had synchronization problems with the new, faster machine and its
all-soft-synth MIDI processor, so that ultimately forced me to move to CW7.
</P><P>
Yet ANOTHER change was happening at the same time - Toby had found another, better 
MIDI-to-Wav renderer, TiMIDIty, that used actual Gravis Ultrasound patches, and was free
and so could render ANY MIDI instrument (remember, I had to hack WavMaker just to get
drums working).  For those NWB tracks I did the drums in WavMaker but rendered the keyboards
in TiMIDIty, and recorded the guitars/bass/vox in Cakewalk.  Mixing down entailed
creating two 'dummy' tracks in the song files and mixing down to stereo to those two tracks,
then exporting those two tracks to stereo WAV, but still, the sound quality was VASTLY
improved by never touching tape, and it was still quicker than mixing to a tape machine
in realtime.
</P><P>
That setup served me well, and so I did Monolith the same way, except this time completely
shifting over to TiMIDIty for all MIDI rendering, including the drums.  The guitar arrangements
got far more intricate than I'd ever done before, and between drum tracks, keys, and all 
the guitars/bass/vocal tracks I had anywhere from 8-14 tracks per song - FAR more than 
I'd ever been able to manage with Magix and the Bellum setup (the most complex song on
that one was drums, four guitars, vox, and bass, plus MIDI keys).  I used the same
setup to record the track for the Beherit tribute too.
</P><HR><P>
Just after the Beherit tribute was done, though, I made my final move: to Sonar 2.  The
Sonar line is the next evolution of Cakewalk, and it's MIGHTY powerful.  A much-improved
audio engine allows support for as many audio/MIDI tracks as your PC can handle, support
for DirectSound and DirectX inputs, and MOST importantly the ability to render MIDI to
audio on the fly via DirectX Instruments/synths (DXIs).  In english, that means NO MORE
PRE-RENDERING OF MIDI TRACKS!  Also, mixdown doesn't require a pre-export bounce to stereo - 
I just export audio and it goes straight out, exactly as it sounds in the program.  This
was how I recorded the Venom Tribute tracks and the Countess cover for the "Displeasures"
EP.
</P><P>
However, between the Countess cover and Displeasures, I made one final important upgrade:
Soundcard.  The builtin SoundBlaster LIVE! that came with the PC was doing the job, but when
I migrated to Sonar I noticed some real latency problems, and ultimately became unhappy
with the sound quality.  After some suggestions and recommendations I came away with a new
soundcard: the AudioTrak MAYA 44.  It's a 4-in 4-out multitrack Soundcard that can record up
to four inputs at once and send them out the same way.  Or any way you mix them.  The latency
issues I had were demolished, and the sound quality is crisp and clear.  It's never
sounded better.  All of the tracks on the "Displeasures" EP were recorded on this soundcard,
and after hearing them you'll wonder how I ever managed to get by on that old HP-166 machine 
and it's little SoundBlaster...

<I>The heart of Bloody Leg Studios.  The computer is on the left, and the
gear on the right.  Behind the mixer is the tape deck I use for ripping, with the
rack gear on top.  On top of the rack gear are the two main distortion pedals I 
used before getting the Rocktron amp, and the power strip I'm too lazy to put
under the table.</I>
</P><HR width=40%><P>
That brings us up to the present, but I realize that I left out a mention of when I first
got a mixer and how that affected recording, but that really gets into the range of offboard
gear, and that's a whole other article.... So, for now, a basic rundown of Bloody
Leg Studios:

<LI>PC: Dell Dimension 4100 - PIII-933 MHz, 120GB system drive+20GB audio drive,
256 MB RAM, AudioTrak Maya 44 4-in/4-out multitrack soundcard.</LI>
<LI>Software suite: Sonar 2 (unlimited digital audio and MIDI tracks, 
support for DXis and any DX effects, seamless integration of external wave
editors like SoundForge, WaveLab, WaveStudio, etc).</LI>

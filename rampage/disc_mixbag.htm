<P><B>Vic's thoughts on this big pile of shit</B>:</P>
<P>Careful what you ask for - you just might get it.</P>
<P>This disc got compiled after talking with one of Rampage's biggest
fans, Mlotek (formerly of LARM - RIP).  (That RIP is for LARM, not Mlotek.)
(Though, now that I think about it, I haven't heard from Mlotek in years.  But
I digress...)  In talking with Mlotek about the 96-97 'boombox' era of the band
I mentioned that Paul and I, in addition to making tapes of many of the songs
that would end up on TEU, Bellum, Misogyny, and Monolith, we recorded probably
close to 70 cover songs of various things, from stuff we liked to stuff we 
hated but could play to stuff we just wanted to take the piss out of.  Mlotek
bugged me incessantly to let him hear some of it.
</P><P>"It's AWFUL!" I warned him.  He insisted.  So I decided to give him what
he asked for.  At least a taste of it.  I compiled a handful (discful?) of the
least insulting/embarrassing covers we did, plus a few odds and ends that would
later end up being real songs, and put it together as 'Vic's Mixed Bag of
Shit'.  And so here you have this disc.  Or not, actually, as I think only
about four or five sold before I put it OOP.</P>
<P>In retrospect, it's not THAT embarrassing, and it is a lot of fun.  We were
drunk, just trying to have fun and not even making these tapes with the intention
of anyone else hearing them, so it's probably entertaining in that 'slice of life'
type of way, or maybe so you can hear just how bad we are when our pants are down,
figuratively speaking.</P>
<P>As for the cover and title thing, I had gone through a short phase after I 
saw the movie Rob Roy where I used 'Shite' instead of 'Shit', and thought that
doing that faux-olde-englyshe type spelling for the layout would be funny.
Of course, it went over about as well as the disc itself.  So count yourself
doubly lucky it's OOP.  Trust me.

<P>Changes are few, but important.</P>

  First, this website has been resurrected. I've updated what I think needs
  updating, but I may have missed something.  I'm looking at more longer-range 
  changes for the site, so those things will get fixed as this site does.

  Second, I'm only now making official what has been the de facto case for
  seven years - Rampage is on a temporary hiatus. I've wasted a few years on
  other things, but now I'm ready to start making music again.  For now, it will
  be with my other projects, but new Rampage ideas are coming to fruition, albeit
  slowly. However, those have necessitated changes in things around here, which
  leads to...

  Third, I have decided to go back to Rampage being my solo project. Aerik is busy
  terrorizing New York City with Lucifer Jones, and we wish him the best. And we may
  well collaborate in the future. But, whatever Rampage is becoming, it's something
  I have to decide for myself.

  Finally, this means that the few releases we've had announced for the past several
  years are cancelled. <I>Bellum Aeternum</I>, <I>Misogyny II</I>, the <I>Misogyny I</I>
  re-recording, and <I>Fucked Raw</I> are consigned to the dustbin of history.

Rampage is a collaboration of Vic Evicerator and Aerik Von. The band's roots go all the way back to 
Vic's very first musical exploits when he was thumping out crude, harsh riffs and cruder, harsher
vocals with a few high school friends into a boombox condenser mic in true bedroom rock-star fashion.
The year was 1989 - a time when it looked like the rumblings of thrash and death metal would be the death of
hair bands, and grunge was something you scraped off the bottom of your shoe. Nothing came of these
self-styled "Pissed Off Teenz" initially, though Vic would take that search for metal that was honest,
heavy, and loud forward through the next seven years and his musical path-walking with other bands.
</P>
<P>
By 1996 Vic had finally parted ways with those other bands having learned enough to try 
to forge forward on his own. Technology had finally progressed far enough that one person
could quite easily conceive, write, record, and release music on their own, and so after a 
couple of years of trial and error and experimentation he resurrected Rampage, this time as
a solo project, and from 1998 through 2003 Vic used Rampage to explore the boundaries of
one-man metal songsmithing.
</P>
<P>
Through various methods of internet self-promotion and the notoriety gained by Rampage
and other bands on Vic's label Unsung Heroes Records he began to attract the attention
of other like-minded individuals and bands - among them a guitarist/vocalist from 
New-York based metal band Black Moon Rising, one Aerik Von. After a couple of years of contact
and conversation the idea was brought up, and Vic and Von joined forces under the Rampage
banner for their inaugural release, <I>Displeasures of the Flesh</I>.
</P>
<P>
From the release of <I>Displeasures...</I> in 2004 through the <I>Ticket to Hell</I>
websingle and the <I>Crimson Frost</I> EP in 2005/2006, Vic and Von tapped into
a common artistic vision, and plans for many more releases were hatched... until the
Universe decided that it just wasn't the time. Vic and Von each left in their own
directions to explore their own paths. Rampage was left for dead.
</P>
<P>
From death springs new life, and so in 2022 the paths of Vic and Von meet again,
and Rampage rises from the earth, Back from the Dead, to realize some of those
promises of old and to explore new paths borne from the knowledge that each
has gained along the way.

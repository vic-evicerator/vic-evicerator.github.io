<P>In the not-too-distant past I had some bold words here
stating my purpose for the existence of Rampage.</P>
<P>Then, I had some less-bombastic words that proclaimed
our purpose - making music that we felt came as our honest
artistic expressions to the world.</P>
<P>They still reeked of bombast.</P>
<P>One of the lessons I kept returning to in every literature
and writing course I ever took was that, no matter what I thought
of what I was doing, the best reactions to anything I created came
when I gave up with trying to be something and just expressed 
some idea with nothing more in mind than making that particular
expression in the most honest, direct way.</P>
<P>
I'm a metalhead, and I like many different kinds of metal. When I 
get an idea that I want to express, I'll dive in all the way
and do it, hopefully without worrying about anything more than
"Is this the target I'm aiming at, and how close am I to hitting
it?".

<h2>Vic Speaks - about gear, again (an update)</H2>
<HR>
<TABLE width=60%><TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>Well, I knew that once I set in stone what gear I used on what albums 
that I would end up recording something else and then have to update
it.  However, I hate saying 'page updated' in web design - it smacks of
laziness, to me.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course;
David Lamb would be proud.  But I should really redesign things so that 
I have the gear set aside in a separate article all on its own, away from
this commentary.
</P><P>
But you didn't come here to see my musings about web design - you want to 
learn what Rampage used since you last heard.
</P><P>
The first thing I did was the Death Beast bass sessions, over the
summer of 2004.  I used my P-bass for all the tracks, as I wanted a 
more vintage, classic sound.  I also used my Rocktron to emulate a
Fender Bassman to give it some body and room sound - and turning up
the drive just a touch gave it that nice amount of 'clean dirt' that
separates great bass tones from just good ones.
</P><P>
The sounds I used for that got me thinking about Crimson Frost and
what I would use there.  I knew I didn't want the full-crushing
distortion on the bass I got on the New World Blasphemy tracks,
but I did want something very dirty and edgy.  As it happens, with
a few more amp emulations and experimenting with the drive level and
EQ, I managed to get different sounds for all four tracks.  I used the
P-bass on all four tracks for <I>Crimson Frost</i>, again, and went between
a robust, classic tone on the title track to a very gritty, trebly
type of 'grinding' bass sound on "Ritual Curse".  
</P><P>For the guitars on <I>Crimson Frost</I>
I just tweaked the same amp settings I had used on the <I>Displeasures</I>
EP and used the Jackson V for all four songs.  The lead tone originally 
was just my trademark Rockman chorus unit, but experimenting with 'keyboards'
changed things.  I had the idea to replace all the keyboard parts in
"Black Flames" with a guitar instead, but a really spacey, keyboard-sounding
guitar.  Using all the amp's built-in effects, I just piled stuff on
and stretched the settings until I got what you hear - and ended up liking
the key sound so much that I used it for the leads on the title track.  I think
it's a combination of a phaser, delay, heavy chorus, and a wah with no sweep.
</P><P>
By contrast, the Websingle was VERY quick and painless.  I went direct, 
just like the old days, from instrument to pedal to comp-lim to the mixer.
I used the Jackson (again) for all the guitars, added the wah to the mix
for most of the solos, and gave the Metal Zone pedal a workout.  For the
bass I gave my old Destroyer one last hurrah.
</P><P>
And yes, by 'last hurrah' I mean it's gone.  I sold it to get money and make
room for a new guitar I want, a red Stratocaster with a maple fretboard.  I've
been wanting one of these ever since I first picked up air guitar as a little kid
after seeing Mark Knopfler make it look so easy.  Hell, I may knock out a cover
of Tunnel of Love or Sultans of Swing just in homage to the master.  If it wouldn't
embarrass me, that is...

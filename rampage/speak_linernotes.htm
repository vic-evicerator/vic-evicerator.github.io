<h2>Vic Speaks - about lost liner notes</H2>
<HR>
<TABLE width=60%><TR><TD colspan=3>
<P>
This is a hoot.  I was cleaning off my PC, digging around for lyrics that I know Aerik
sent me, and in doing so I stumbled into a directory that had the stuff for the booklet
of <I>Displeasures of the Flesh</I>.  Among the Photoshop files and such were two text 
files - 'linernotes.txt' and 'thx_list.txt'.  Since I thought the two were redundant
(after all, if you have the disc, you know the only liner notes ARE the thanks lists...) I
opened them up to see which one was current and which was older.</P>
<P>Instead, I found two pages of liner notes that were supposed to go into the book. Talk about
oops...</P>
<P>It's too late to reprint shit, especially since there's no room in the booklet anyway, so
here are your liner notes.  Enjoy...

Welcome to the first RAMPAGE recording featuring YOURS TRULY!  I am very excited
to see a finish product finally as it will silence the mouths that run and give 
the fans some great new recordings to bang their pointy little horns to.  Vic and
I have known each other for quite some time and this new music is certainly a step
in a 'new' direction.  The melodies, time signatures and covers were not the kinds
of thing that Vic, with his hoarse style of singing could never really work out.
Finally we have something that sounds pretty damned heavy, yet is moving this 'Rampage'
name into a whole new direction.  Don't think we've forgotten the past of this act
though...as Vic and I both agree on so much musically that it's hard for us to see
this as 'starting over'.  The cover of "The Wrath of Satan's Whore" dates back to
1998 when I first heard the track.  (I remember when Barbarian Wrath still works
out of cjb.net unlike most of those who jumped ship in the past two years...)  The
song converted me beyond the shallow vestiges of Black Metal that I was interested in
(such as early 'evil' thrash bands) and led me to jump into the genre with Opyros
(now Black Goat) as my guide.  While we don't talk much now, he kept me away from
the terrible tunes and introduced me to all of the amazing black metal that few 
in the underground will ever know about.  Vic, of course, took over his American
distribution (after a first failed attempt...I guessed Vic was doing it before Goat
even announced his name) he and I slowly became fast friends due to a united hatred
of the increasingly stupid Black Metal scene and the general idiocy of the metal
community.  (Hence, how we are able to work together since few othes understand 
our strict musical views...)  I loved UHR, I loved Rampage and now I'm in Rampage.
Rampage is not any one form of metal...it is just Rampage.  Now we.ve composed some
new songs for you, there is a new voice and a new chance to expand what Rampage 
is all about.  I inspire Vic, Vic inspires me...
Now that I've talked a little about this and that
I think you should simply listen to the record and enjoy the sounds of a new EP.
The recording was hell (read the story on the website) but the end result is one
of my happiest moments...

Rampage till death... I feel like I've always been a member...

====================

Rampage is dead - Long Live Rampage.

When I chose the cover art and title for "Monolith to an Abandoned Past" I thought,
semi-jokingly to myself, "I should just end the band right here."

Effectively, I did.  Only I didn't know it at the time.  My control-freak tendencies
and constant chasing of something I thought I wanted just led me down blind alley
after dead end for over two years... and after that kind of separation I didn't know
if I even had it in me anymore.

Still, all of that time off and floundering around trying things that just weren't
right for the band helped me figure out exactly what WAS right.  Content, musical
direction, style... all of that changed, of course, but what was also right was
the need for a new voice behind the mic.  Hell... again, to myself, I'd been telling
myself that since "Bellum Infinitum" when I had to get roaring drunk just to loosen
up enough to do vocals that were passable.  The trouble is, of course, that the control
freak in me wouldn't allow me to let go of the reins and really let the band go where
it needed to on its own.

Somehow a little time and space, and the constant hinting and nudging of a certain
Snxke put the idea in my mind, and thinking about it long enough finally showed me 
how much sense it made.  So here we are.  The way I'd worked with Rampage for the past
decade was gone, but somehow I've gotten closer than ever to doing exactly what I thought
Rampage was all about.  By releasing the stranglehold of control I let it breathe
and grow into its own beast, and now I think this is the blueprint of a long, dark
future that lies ahead.

"But hey, enough of my yappin'... Whadda ya say?  Let's boogie!"
(Bonus point - name the movie...)

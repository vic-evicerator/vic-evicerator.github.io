<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>UHR Sampler Collection IV</I></B>:</P>
<P>Aerik gets all the credit for this one, as I was terribly busy
at the time this was compiled, so I asked him to give me what his
picks would be for the whole sampler if he were compiling it.  Well,
as it turned out, his picks were so good I just kept them.  It also
helped that they worked out to just about 42 minutes, leaving just
enough time for me to add on that radio interview track at the end.

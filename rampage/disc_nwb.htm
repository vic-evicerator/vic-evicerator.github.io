<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>New World Blasphemy</I></B>:</P>
<P>"Conceit" is now the way I'd characterize this release - the conceit
that just by listening to something and understanding something that one
can thereby DO that thing.  For the past few years I had been listening
to more and more black metal, and getting into more of those kind of bands, 
even getting a few of them onto UHR, so I thought that it would be easy for
me to just write some black metal with Rampage.
</P>
<P>
Riffs and snippets of songs appeared here and there
but nothing really inspired me - until I came across the intro riff
to "Black Flames...".  It almost wrote itself in a day or two.  The next
day (I confess, after listening to Barathrum's <I>Eerie</I> album...) I
was toying with a more primitive ritualistic-type of feel, and the 
drumbeat and throbbing bass riff of "Ritual Curse" popped out of nowhere.
Another day or two later that song was finished.  I was far from ready to 
release an album, but I wanted to get these
tracks out there.  Luckily, at the time I had just gotten in contact with
some raw, underground USBM bands (Song of Melkor, Chernobog, Cross Sodomy, 
Enbilulugugal...), and after some back-and-forths I managed to organize
this split release with SOM and Cross Sodomy.</P>
<P>I got it organized, released, and then started working on the next
album... when nothing happened.  I started about 20 songs and abandoned
them all... they were all too obvious, or too tired/trite sounding,
or just plain cloned.  Looking at it then, I thought it was just 
writer's block, and that continuing to 'work' on the problem would
fix it.  Now, though, I think I understand what writer's block really
is - it's your subconscious telling you that something you're doing isn't
what you really want or need to do.
</P>
<P>I gave up, dejected at the time, and then <I>Monolith...</I> fell
together.  I still thought I could just 'clean the closet' and end that
'old chapter' of Rampage by getting Monolith out of my system.  It 
fell together so easily that I should have suspected something, but at
the time I didn't care - I was just happy that my plate was empty and
I could start to 'really' work on the next Rampage 'black metal' album.
</P>
<P>Of course, it didn't happen, and now I have the perspective of time
enough to see why - I'm just not a black metal musician.  Now I'm okay
with it.  No matter how well these songs are crafted, that's all they are - 
CRAFTED.  Not written, really - just combined/rehashed ideas of all the
black metal I'd listened to before, but without the spontaneous feel
or natural feel of Rampage's early demo material.</P>
<P>Next time I'll listen to my muse more carefully.  She's always right
in the end anyway....</P>

<H3>Vic's Thoughts on <I>This End Down</I></H3>

<DIV class="narrow"> <!-- Width DIV START -->

<P>Despite taking 16 years to come to fruition, the idea stayed the same - 
Take some of what we thought were our best songs, knock out some quick 
rehearsal-style music, give it a vocal pass or two, and put it out there.
Since we're not a live band, this is the closest thing we'll be able to 
put out in the vein of a live gig or live album, and the stripped-down
approach gives a more honest view of the music and our interpretations
of it. Also, given the depth of the back catalog compared to the amount
that Aerik has sung on, I think it's interesting to hear what a real vocalist
can do with what I write.</P>
<P>Right about the time I was recording what would have been the <I>Misogyny II</I>
EP and the rerecorded Bellum, I also knocked out some covers. I did them in two
batches - four songs in my usual style, tuned down to D, focusing on the death/thrash
side of things as I did with Death Beast and on <I>This End Up</I>. The inclusion
of "Here Comes the War" was specifically requested by Aerik because he wanted
to give his own lyrics a crack to see what he could do with it. The other four
were more on the doom/epic side, and since I was tuning down an extra half-step
for that EP I thought the lower tuning would fit some of the Monolith-era
songs and "Displeasures..." pretty well. A Sabbath cover is also floating
around out there from these same sessions, by the way...</P>
<P>Anyway, I recorded these tracks at the end of 2005 and into early January 2006,
then sent them to Aerik just before life split our paths in separate directions.
We did try to reconvene a couple of times in the intervening years, but 
ultimately nothing came of it.</P>
<P>Once Aerik and I reconnected and recommitted to work in early 2022, 
he asked for these tracks again. Since his studio is in-house now, he could
work on them easily, and within two weeks of me giving him all of the music
we had a finished rehearsal album.</P>

<H3>Aerik's thoughts on <I>This End Up</I>:</H3>
<P>
Well, This End Up was the first Rampage recording I heard about two-three years ago
and in many ways it is still the one I crawl back to whenever I'm in a mood to shatter
some skulls.  I remember the one-two punch of "Satanic Death" and "Bloody Leg" and
only wondering how these tracks would come across had Vic NOT been the singer...even
so, the strength of the melodies helped keep me in the listening game.
</P>
<P>
Not long after I had contacted Vic himself about possibly releasing Black Moon Rising
material and a long-term friendship has since been building that has lead to my 
joining the band at this time.  Overall, this record is the first, the most "rocking"
and the one that convinced me that Vic was a largely "unsung hero" of the metal 
scene.  (So funny, I made myself vomit with disgust, am I!) 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't picked this up yet, the dual solos on "Satanic Death", the moody "Six
Bells at Midnight" and the churning "Bloody Leg" still make regular rounds in my
player...and will probably bear my voice at some point in the near future.  "This 
End Up" may not be the most original (*cough*POSSESSED*cough*) record known to the
history of man, but it certainly rates high on the "beat the fuck out of your stereo
speakers" factor and has more hooks than in a horror movie with the victims finding
themselves in a meat packing plant.
</P>
<P>
My hails to a great first LP...the one that got me interested in the first place...

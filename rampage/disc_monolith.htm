<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Monolith to an Abandoned Past</I></B>:</P>
<P>It's so nice to finally have this album done with after four years...</P>
<P>The original intent was to have the first three songs on this album, along with
a few other doom songs, released under the title "Doom Metal".  This is back when
I thought I could have my cake and eat it too with regards to humor in music.  The
thing is there's little funny about doom metal (well, unless it's done badly, but that's
another story...), and me trying to force that bleakness with tongue-in-cheek like I 
did with death/thrash metal on <I>This End Up</I> just didn't work.  I could never write
anything worthy of fitting alongside those three tracks, and even trying to jump-start
the writing process by starting to record didn't work (this is why the song "Doom Metal" was
released as a single back in 1999 - I never got farther than that one song).  I figured at
that point that I would try to be serious and finish <I>Bellum...</I> then get back to it.
But, as is often the case in life, outside events interfered and that never happened....</P>
<P>After re-evaluating my direction for Rampage in early 2001 I remembered these songs
again.  I'm never the kind to work on something and leave it uncompleted, and for what they
were I thought they were good songs, and I felt they needed to be released somehow.  After
returning to them, inspiration finally hit me.  I remembered some of the other ideas that never
came to fruition in '99, and they started to spring up naturally now.  They're much more serious in
tone than the earlier songs, which is the reason I've divided the album into 'chapters' - just as 
I worked on them in different mindsets, I feel they can only be best appreciated with different
mindsets, so do keep the tracklist and chapters in mind as you listen.</P>
<P>Just as I was finishing this album I received an invitation to participate in
Christcrusher Productions' Mayhem Tribute album.  The band that had committed to doing
"Funeral Fog" was forced to drop out, and ChorazaiM recommended to CP's chief Herr Chemosh
that I could step it.  Chemosh offered, I eagerly accepted (that was always my favorite Mayhem
track), and two weeks later the cover was finished.  I've also included it here because I think
it fits the tone of the album in an odd way, and it's also my way of paying tribute to
Dead and Euronymous, whose work with Mayhem really got me interested in moving in a more black
direction - it's fitting that they help me close the door on the past....</P>
<P>There was nothing particularly hellish about recording.  I was pretty comfortable with the
upgraded studio software I had been using since the NWB tracks, and in fact I even went back
to my older guitar and bass for some different sounds on some tracks.  This is the first time
that I commissioned artwork specifically for the album - I asked my wife, a photographer, to take
some pictures in a graveyard that I thought would be interesting, and we took the best
shots for the booklet, the back of the booklet, and the tray inlay.</P>

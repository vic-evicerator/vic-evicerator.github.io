<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Satanic Symphonies</I></B>:</P>
<P>This one gets filed under the "What the F#@K was I thinking?" category.
I mean, yeah, we wrote these songs and recorded them onto a boombox
with the equivalent of a shitty guitar amp and tupperware.  At the time
we didn't even intend for them to get out.  I blame Mlotek - he begged and
begged me to give him dubs of these demos, and I did.  I hope he's sorry I 
did, too...
</P>
<P>
Anyway, as I told in the history, from 1996-1998 Paul and I would get together
every few months, set up the boombox and 'drumkit', and just bash stuff out 
and record it.  We'd listen to the tapes, rewrite stuff, touch up things,
write new songs, and then next time we'd end up rerecording all of the
old stuff plus whatever new came out.  If I remember right, though, most
of the versions on this compilation came from the last session we recorded together,
with perhaps one or two being dredged up from earlier sessions and tacked together
to present the 'best' versions of all the songs together at once.  Some of the oldest
songs (Wanderlust, Doom Metal, DeadRot) are here on their third or fourth go-round,
while others were brand-new for this album (Rampage, Six Bells at Midnight).</P>
<P>
Believe me, it's NOT worth tracking down, unless you just want to embarrass me, 
but even that won't work, because I'm plenty embarrassed enough as it is
just admitting this thing exists.  Just be glad I never released the boombox
version of <I>Bellum Infinitum</I>....

<P>This record is absolutely amusing to me.  It really is... I can't say much for this
demo other than that Vic came up with some great songs to record later.  This though...is
just humorous.  I can't say anything more...I'm glad I didn't sing on it!

<P>
Well, ya gotta start somewhere - and in our case, 'somewhere' was Augusta, Georgia, in the only
Catholic high school in the area. Paul and Vic and their friend Ben, all victims of the 
Diocesean school system and aficionados of Nintendo games, Dungeons & Dragons, Marvel Comics,
and heavy metal (the louder and faster the better), regularly got together to take refuge in
various escapes and pastimes. An aborted attempt by Paul and Vic to join a band ended up resulting
in the two of them playing guitar and bass (respectively), trying to get enough together to make
something like a song. Mostly it came out like noise.
</P>
<P>
Until that one fateful day in the Summer of 1989, when Ben (who had joined Paul and Vic on one of 
their last noisy, messy 'recording' sessions) got Paul and Vic together and started shouting
directions - "Paul - give me a riff!" "Vic, take a solo!". In between we'd hurriedly decide on
a song title and Ben would make up shit off the top of his head - and one whole afternoon later
the "Pissed Off Teenz" album was complete. Rather than stupid conversations and bad jokes interspersed
with the occasional riff or hacky take on a Metallica song, it actually approached the level of
'bad bedroom metal band', in that it had very few digressions and about a dozen actual (if mostly 
dreadful) songs. But if any description could be given to it, it would be: "Better than it should
have been" - and that was good enough for the gang.
</P>
<P>
We tried recording on other days later that summer, but none of them had that charm of
the one magical day. Summer ended, then the realities of school and, that being senior year,
life running its usual course after that meant that Vic's musical exploits devolved mainly
to woodshedding on his bass and marking time until it was the day to leave for college,
down the highway about two hours in the more-likely-to-be-musically-fruitful town of 
Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta lived up to its promise as Vic met a pair of guitar players literally within the first few 
minutes of moving into his dorm that first day. Networking, bulletin boards, meeting with
friends-of-friends-of-friends, and eventually falling in with the campus student musician's club
finally put Vic in touch with his first band, Early Warning. Four years of gigging and demos resulted
in connections with many other musicians and, ultimately, a skip over to another band, Skiptoe, for
another year of more gigs and demos. By 1996, though, out of college and ready to move on, Vic
decided to transition to being a solo musician.
</P>
<P>Fate would ultimately reconnect Vic and Paul, both now far removed from the high-school-era
birth mindset and environment and with many more years of musical development under their belts.
A few long-distance road trip recording sessions with months of writing in between resulted
in Vic creating a wealth of metal songs of varying styles and sounds, songs that would ultimately
form the backbone of the new Rampage's first few releases.</P>

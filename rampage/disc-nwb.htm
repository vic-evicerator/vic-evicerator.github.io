<DIV class="narrow"> <!-- Width DIV START -->

<P>"Conceit" is now the way I'd characterize this release - the conceit
that just by listening to something and understanding something that one
can thereby DO that thing.  For the past few years I had been listening
to more and more black metal, and getting into more of those kind of bands, 
even getting a few of them onto UHR, so I thought that it would be easy for
me to just write some black metal with Rampage.
</P>
<P>
Riffs and snippets of songs appeared here and there
but nothing really inspired me - until I came across the intro riff
to "Black Flames...".  It almost wrote itself in a day or two.  The next
day (I confess, after listening to Barathrum's <I>Eerie</I> album...) I
was toying with a more primitive ritualistic-type of feel, and the 
drumbeat and throbbing bass riff of "Ritual Curse" popped out of nowhere.
Another day or two later that song was finished.  I was far from ready to 
release an album, but I wanted to get these
tracks out there.  Luckily, at the time I had just gotten in contact with
some raw, underground USBM bands (Song of Melkor, Chernobog, Cross Sodomy, 
Enbilulugugal...), and after some back-and-forths I managed to organize
this split release with SOM and Cross Sodomy.</P>
<P>I got it organized, released, and then started working on the next
album... when nothing happened.  I started about 20 songs and abandoned
them all... they were all too obvious, or too tired/trite sounding,
or just plain cloned.  Looking at it then, I thought it was just 
writer's block, and that continuing to 'work' on the problem would
fix it.  Now, though, I think I understand what writer's block really
is - it's your subconscious telling you that something you're doing isn't
what you really want or need to do.
</P>
<P>I gave up, dejected at the time, and then <I>Monolith...</I> fell
together.  I still thought I could just 'clean the closet' and end that
'old chapter' of Rampage by getting Monolith out of my system.  It 
fell together so easily that I should have suspected something, but at
the time I didn't care - I was just happy that my plate was empty and
I could start to 'really' work on the next Rampage 'black metal' album.
</P>
<P>Of course, it didn't happen. Not immediately, anyway. Earlier, I thought
that it was because I just wasn't a black metal musician - I couldn't reach
that level of darkness I thought it needed. <I>Crimson Frost</I> proved that
wasn't the case, and it was instead something else - I was too busy trying
to capture what others did with Black Metal instead of just taking the 
evil vibe and looking for my own take on it. Fortunately Aerik helped
me see that and together we realized it a few years after this release.</P>
<P>And we just might get back there again someday.</P>

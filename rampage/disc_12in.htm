<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Twelve Inches of Blasphemy</I></B>:</P>
<P>
Not long after the Hellhammer tribute I did with Megiddo, ChorazaiM and I
talked about doing some kind of tribute to Venom. Our first thought was to
do the whole Welcome to Hell album, but that would have been a bit of an
overkill. Chor suggested we just pick four tracks each, but confine ourselves
to only non-album tracks that came from singles and EPs. We each made
our picks, and not long after I first made the transition to the new
Bloody Leg Studios I recorded the basic tracks and some scratch vocals.
I don't recall now exactly how it came about, but before I could totally get
the tracks finished we decided to put the split on hold, and so the songs sat
in this half-done state for years.

In 2006 I was forced into a long hiatus and I knew I wanted some new release
for Rampage to tide everyone over while I waited on new material. I remembered
these tracks at about the same time I was talking with Ramrod of Chemikiller
about doing something together. In the year before we had each tried, unsuccessfully,
to guest on each other's projects (me trying to play bass for Chemikiller, him trying
to join as vocalist of Death Beast). I remembered that Chemikiller had done
some Venom tracks for an old online Venom tribute that UHR hosted back in the early 2000s.
I asked Ramrod if he would mind if we pressed those tracks together with my old
tracks and put it out as a split. He said okay, I polished off the Venom
tracks by spit-shining the tracks with some EQ and better drum sample sounds.

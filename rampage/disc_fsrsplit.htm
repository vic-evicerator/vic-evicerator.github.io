<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Doom Metal</I></B>:</P>
<P>The same day I released <I>This End Up</I>
I started working on a cover of Venom's "Leave Me in Hell" for the UHR online
Tribute that I had organized with Jason Christie of Gortician.  I finished it
and then a few days later decided to knock out a cover of Immortal's "Unsilent
Storms..." just for fun.  I posted it exclusively on the webpage at the time, 
but then pulled it down when I decided to put it on the split CD.  "Doom Metal"
was recorded right after the Immortal cover, about March or April 1999.  At the time, I had intended to 
finish the <I>Doom Metal</i> album first and then record <i>Bellum Infinitum</I>,
but after finishing this song I decided against it.  As you can hear, I had 
improved the sounds I could get out of the studio quite a bit from the first demo,
and I felt at the time I just couldn't wait any longer to hear the whole <i>Bellum...</I>
album fully realized.</P>
<P>Since I decided to put this out quickly just to get it out of the way, I was
hard-pressed to think of a way to do it, since three songs (two of them covers) 
is almost not worth the effort on its own.  Fortunately, I had finally gotten a
decent demo out of Festering Sore at the time, and with all of the splits going
around the underground at the time I thought it was a natural move.</P>

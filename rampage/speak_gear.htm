<h2>Vic Speaks - about outboard gear</H2>

In earlier entries I talked about my instruments and my studio PC.  However, there's a whole world of
shit that goes between the two, and since that plays a huge part in the sound and method of Rampage, I
figure I ought to complete the tale - but let's start at the beginning:
</P>

My first bass amp was some shitty 25-watt Peavey guitar amp that the person who sold me my first
short-scale bass included.  I don't even remember the model number.  I got rid of it when I got my
first real bass amp, a Peavey TKO-75 75-watt bass amp - it had graphic and parametric EQs, an effects
loop, and a single 15" speaker.  I didn't have it for the infamous POT session, since I got it for
bastard-mas that year.  I kept that amp for a long time, using it on all the Early Warning demo
recordings, but before our first gig I had managed to upgrade to a real setup...
</P><P class="l">
Late in 1991 I got a full bass rig that consisted of a Gallien-Krueger GK800RB bass head, a Hartke
4x10 cabinet (the nifty kind with the aluminum speaker cones), and a Mesa-Boogie 1x15 cabinet.  The GK
amp had a variable crossover, and so I split the signal with the highs to the 410 and the lows to the
115.  I also got a Boss rackmount compressor-limiter to help smooth out the bass sound and a Rockman
chorus unit for solos, clean parts, and the like.  The best thing about that head was that it had a
direct XLR out, so no fighting with the soundman about idiotic direct boxes and no fucking around with
micing the speakers for recording.</P><P>&nbsp;</P>

I traded away the 410 to get my Warlock guitar back when Rampage started again in 1996, but I kept the
rest of the gear and it served me well for recording.  All I needed to add was distortion, but one
Boss Metal Zone pedal later and I had my sound... it worked through the amp, the direct out sounded
great on 'tape', and the chorus and comp-lim worked fine for effects and signal processing.  I used
that basic setup all the way from the first "Misogyny" demo through to the Hellhammer tribute.  I
miced the amp for the live album just for a more authentic sound, but other than that I never worried
about outboard gear...
</P>

<P class="r">
...until I was recording the acoustic guitar for "The Wakening" on <I>Bellum Infinitum</I>, that is. 
No matter how much I turned up the mic input I couldn't get much signal, and that's when I realized a
desktop mixer would be a great addition to my studio.  I mean, I managed to make it work without a
mixer for vocals by compressing the shit out of them and running noise reduction, but I still had the
'pop' problem and a mixer would solve that as well.  I borrowed an old 2-channel DJ mixer from my
brother to do vocals for the Hellhammer tribute, and on a lark decided to try going direct through
that for guitars and bass as well.  It worked out pretty well, and started me on the way to ditching
an amp for recording.

After a clearance sale at a music chain store I came away with a Phonic 6-channel 10-input mixer for
pretty cheap.  Easy to mix a small band or moderate-sized drum kit, and perfect for simple desktop
input to the PC.  I leave it set up on the desk with the main outs going into my PC, and that way
anything I want to plug into the PC I just put into any channel of the mixer I choose.  Since it
functions as a preamp I run 'direct' through that, using it to get vocals up to a good level easily
and to even out other things I have to mic.  Plugging my guitar through my comp-lim, chorus, and
distortion pedal into the mixer got a great, sharp sound that I used on the New World Blasphemy tracks
and later for Monolith (after my amp started acting up).
</P><P class="l">
However, I realized I didn't want to be completely without an amp even though I never used the GK
anymore, so I got the idea to sell the rig and use that money to buy a decent-sized guitar amp.  One
traipse through the music store's used section got me a great lightly-used Rocktron RepliTone 2x12
combo.  It's a digital/solid state head that has amp emulation for 15 different amps, onboard effects
(chorus, phaser, wah, etc.), delay and echo/reverb built in, and most importantly a direct-out in the
back that works for headphones or direct line recording.  Since that line out comes after all the
processing/effects, you can get that room sound just by adding the right touch of reverb, and it
sounds like a miced amp, not a line-in direct sound.  I plugged the amp out straight in for recording
on the "Displeasures" EP, and I've never been happier with the sound...

That about covers it, except for the odd details about the little things like the mics I use, or the
occasional 'other' distortion pedal I use here and there, or the time I had to borrow X from Y... but
that's what the below list is for:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>All those old boombox demos:</B> When I jammed with Paul I used his little Crate combo amp,
some tiny 30-watt thing with a single 12" speaker.  Effects?  We don't need no stinkin' effects!</LI>
<LI><B>Misogyny (April-June 1998):</B> This one pretty much set the stage for the way I ran all my
guitars until I ditched the amp.  I ran the guitar line to the Boss Metal Zone, then into the
Compressor-Limiter to the GK amp.  The Rockman chorus was in the effects loop of the amp, and I ran
the XLR out from the amp straight into the soundcard.  The bass skipped the Metal Zone, but otherwise
used exactly the same signal path.  For vocals I used a little $30 Radio Shack mic that I've basically
used ever since.  I think I did vocals straight into the soundcard - a silly move in retrospect since
I had a perfectly good compressor/limiter...</LI>
<LI><B>This End Up (June-October 1999):</B> Same as before, except I did use the Metal Zone distortion
on the bass for a couple of tracks.  For the borrowed amp I used on the covers, I just plugged from
the pedal straight into the amp, and used the headphone out on that amp straight into the PC.  Vocals
again were on a direct mic, but some annoying pops convinced me to try going through the comp/lim for
vocals on the next release.</LI>
<LI><B>Doom Metal single (early 1999):</B> Same as the Misogyny EP, but with Metal Zone distortion on
the bass for the Venom cover.  For vocals, from this point on, I ran the mic into the comp/lim and
used that as a vocal preamp/limiter and ran that output to the PC.</LI>
<LI><B>Cummin' Atcha Live (Mid-1999):</B> Instead of running direct out, I put the amp in the closet
and miced the speakers on my rig with my vocal mic to record for both guitars and bass - otherwise,
yet again, it was the same old setup.</LI>
<LI><B>Darkthrone Tribute track (June 1999):</B> Back to direct from the amp recording, but otherwise
the same old gear setup, with the Metal Zone yet again getting a workout from the bass.</LI>
<LI><B>Bellum Infinitum (June-December 1999):</B> Wash, rinse, repeat.  For the acoustic guitar I set
the vocal mic on my table as near the guitar as I could get it.  The signal was crap, though, which is
why I started thinking about a mixer/preamp or something for the mic...</LI>
<LI><B>Hellhammer Tribute (December 2000):</B> I got adventurous here, simply running guitar through
the distortion pedal (Metal Zone, again) into the compressor/limiter and used that as a preamp, and
ran that output directly into the soundcard.  Bass just went from the Comp/Lim to the PC.  For vocals
I plugged my mic into the DJ mixer I borrowed and ran that output to the soundcard.</LI>
<LI><B>New World Blasphemy (April/May 2001):</B> I might not have even bothered with the comp/lim on
this one, running both guitars and bass straight from pedal->mixer->PC.  I'm sure I used the comp/lim
for vox though.</LI>
<LI><B>Monolith (August-November 2001):</B> In an effort to go back to a more professional sound I
started using the amp setup again, but after only one or two songs (Doom Metal and Wanderlust) I went
back to just using the Metal Zone, comp/lim, and mixer.</LI>
<LI><B>Beherit cover (early 2002):</B> I don't remember what I did on this one, honestly.  I guess I
ran it all direct (using the comp/lim and mixer).</LI>
<LI><B>Venom covers (mid-2003):</B> I got a new toy for Bastard-mas 2002 - an old Boss DS-1 Distortion
pedal (the orange one).  It had a much more 'vintage', thinner type of sound that I thought fit the
Venom vibe perfectly, so I used it for both guitars and bass, recording direct.</LI>
<LI><B>Countess cover (January 2004):</B> I'm sure I used the Metal Zone on this one, going direct
through the comp/lim and mixer.</LI>
<LI><B>Displeasures (March 2004):</B> For this album, in addition to the new guitar, I also had the
new amp (the Rocktron) and a new Crybaby Wah.  I just ran through the Wah to the amp and used the
amp's direct out into the mixer.</LI>

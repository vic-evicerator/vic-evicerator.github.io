<h2>Aerik Speaks - about the hell of Recording Vox for <I>Displeasures...</I></H2>
<HR>
<TABLE width=60%><TR><TD>
<P>
This was the worst day in recording history.
</P><P>
No shadows, no doubts.
</P><P>
Andrew and I show up to the studio (Funkadelic Studios in Manhattan) at 6pm on 26th
street. This place is cool, it's cheap, it's got rock and roll character and you
can hear every band in the world chopping away ay their material. The people behind
the desk were really cool too. They gave us all sorts of time to work out various
problems and only charged us for what we used. Cool. 
</P><P>
We get our room set up and right as we're about to record vocals the computer dies.
The hard drive is seperated and the computer needs repairs. This is scary, as at
first we imagined that this would be an easy "in and out" sort of scenario.
Oh wait, this is Aerik Von we are talking about. NOTHING can go easily for Aerik
Von. (I'll be writing a bit about the Misfits show to show you how bad my luck really
is.)
</P><P>
We don't panic.
</P><P>
We catch a ride to Soho with some ripoff Pakistani and fifteen minutes later we 
are at the Soho apple store. This guy has no clue where we are going, he drives 
badly and we still owe him $15? Fuck that. At least we got to scare a bunch of old
ladies as we were most certainly not dressed for success. (I was wearing a shirt
that said "Satan is Love" and he had an old school "Danzig skull"
T-shirt. It rocked.) It's also raining out, which contributed to a slight bit of
raspiness in my voice since I got myself a little "under the weather".
</P><P>
$15 for the ride and $16 for the hour in the studio we took trying to fix our gear.
</P><P>
In total?
</P><P>
$31 in damages. Outch.
</P><P>
We enter the store, the line has about thirty people and we are informed that we
may not get served. We want and rave, a few people leave the line and eventually
we get to the counter. Yikes. The hard drive could only be located by another computer
and it took at least twenty minutes. Right. The computer is in huge disrepair, and
poor Andrew has most likely lost everything he ever had on it. Photos, music (YEAH
losing i-tunes music) and everything else is most likely gone for good. (I put little
faith in their ability to save his memory despite the steep price they charged for
trying.) I hate computers. Now nobody in this mess has one. Mine is broken, Andrew's
is broke. Yipee!
</P><P>
This day is starting to rock.
</P><P>
$500 in damages for the computer.
</P><P>
We storm out and return all the way to Columbia University to set up a plan "B".
We call Austin, we call Andrews friend Chris and finally we locate another Macintosh
of the same variety to complete the record. (Chris, btw has a huge apartment on 
the upper West side that must cost a couple million. Impressive! He had a killer
book collection as well.) We spend about an hour downloading the tracks again, installing
pro-tools on his machine and even having to find a code to sneak in and get pro-tools.
(Internet piracy at it's greatest.) Apparently, Jerry Only of the Misfits now lives
somewhere in the midwest and is using an illegal version of pro-tools. I wonder 
if he is aware of this. I hope not, for my sake. Columbia is pretty chill, and Andrew
has a killer Gibson SG and he let me rock out to "The Hangman" on it. 
I loved the piece as it allowed me to crunch things out. I might ask to borrow it
when we finally record the "Black Moon Rising" LP that is coming out soon.
Fuck yeah!
 Despite this fun distraction, we still felt terrified that this whole recording
wasn't going to be completed.
</P><P>
So...three subways rides and dinner. Since we were both pretty fucking hungry.
</P><P>
$11 for both of us individually. 
</P><P>
$22 dollars in damage for food drink and transportation.
</P><P>
Then we finally have a machine and we set up. We had a minor scare (again) with 
a piece of gear not working but with a reboot the gear was working just fine. The
original two or three takes had me singing in an opera styled "power metal"
voice that certainly didn't fit the sings. We were failing miserably, in my view.
This was hardly a good feeling for me, though Andrew thought it was really cool 
that I had previous singing training and the like and could hear that in my voice.
Though, we launched into doing the vocals for "Displeasures of the Flesh"
and "boom". The voice (THE voice) was there. We did many takes, choruses,
mixes, this and that and this and that and it all just seemed to work. I sang, I
screamed and I howled out the lyrics in every terrible way I could. This was fun,
Andrew watched me dance like an asshole, scream like a banshee and talk waaaay too
much. I feel bad, as I talked his ear off the whole time, but I blabber when I get
nervous.
</P><P>
The hard part was now over.
</P><P>
Now for the trip home. I had to buy a new metrocard! He had to use his old one! 
We saw a homeless man sleeping in the trash and he snored so loud it amused us! 
GOD HELP US WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET MUGGED SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY THING LEFT
TO GO WRONG! (It didn't happen...thank his satanic majesty.) We failed to get into
the first subway station we wanted to so we walked a block or two and found ourselves
in a Dunkin' Donuts quite randomly. He got a bagel for about $1.50 and I got a egg-sausage
bagel-thing for $5 and we were off. Funny moments on the way back included a drunk
girl yelling at a homeless man and flipping him off. I was harassed continually 
by a homeless guy on my way back (sadly, I am not even rock star enough to afford
a cab home) and I was exhausted. I scared one more old lady and that was that. Piling
out to Ditmars I felt like a man who had seen a war.
</P><P>
$4 for metrocards!
</P><P>
$32 for the studio time!
</P><P>
Cost of food, metrocards and studio you ask?
</P><P>
$42 in costs 
</P><P>
Andrew and I pretty much "got to know each other" through this whole ordeal
and I think we're actually working on becoming "friends" now. This was
probably the worse experiance involving music I've ever been involved in. Even so...we
have five new Rampage tunes that did not exist previously and this is something 
special.
</P><P>
I fell asleep at 2:20am...it started at 6:00pm. We are veterans.
</P><P>
Cost of recording, broken computers, transportation and foodstuff, you ask?
</P><P>
$595.
</P><P>
Ow.
</P><P>
The price of a newly recorded Rampage EP?
</P><P>
Priceless.
</P><P>
(I like Andrew so much now that we're gonna hang out at the Bellvue this friday.
He'll even drag a few friends down so Jimmy can have more $$$. This adventure was
some sort of sad "bonding experiance". The man has certainly earned his
place among those who have done well by me musically. His balls and dedication are
massive. Hail Satan!)

<DIV class="narrow"> <!-- Width DIV START -->
<P>Just like the last one, it's so nice to finally have this album done...</P>
<P>Well, it wasn't four years like the last one, but two and a half years is nothing
to sneeze at.  And it's not like this one was pre-conceived.  As I've stated before,
it was writer's block.  What I thought I wanted to do wasn't what I needed to do or
felt like doing, and so I couldn't work on what I wanted.  And, above it all, I didn't 
know what I wanted.  I guess the bottom line is that black metal, for me, is like singing:
it's something I love but just can't do well, so best to leave it to those who are
good and concentrate on what I AM good at...</P>
<P>Funny how I changed both things at once.  Fate may be a bitch, but she's a funny one.</P>
<P>As you all may know, I've known Aerik for quite a while, and I'm not sure exactly when the
idea entered my head, but at some point in December 2003 I realized how many conversations
I had had with Aerik that started with him saying "Man, if I was your vocalist, I would....".
Whether that was deliberate on his part or not I don't know, but it did get me thinking
and wondering, and we had been talking about collaborating on projects together anyway
(with him giving me lyrics and me writing music for them).  I guess one day I just decided
"what the fuck?" and figured I'd give it a swing.  I already had the music for a Countess
tribute done, and Aerik had given me a lot of lyrics, so I thought the best idea would be
to introduce him with something like an 'old, new, borrowed, and blue' release - redo an 
old track, write a new one, and throw on a cover or two.  A few conversations later we had
the songs picked, I had lyrics, and in one furious weekend I taught the song to the guys
and we bashed out the first three tracks, then gave the music files to Aerik for recording...
and we all know how THAT story went.... (See Rampage Speaks for his narrative of
the night from hell).</P>

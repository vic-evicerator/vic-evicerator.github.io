<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>In the Shadow of the Horns</I></B>:</P>
<P>Brett Benzie of Destr0y Productions had
been working on a multimedia Darkthrone Tribute for some time (an extension of his
Darkthrone website), but he managed to enlist a LOT of help when he put a request 
for assistance on Usenet.  Most people (like myself) offered to add rare pictures,
or reviews, or essays, or rare mp3s, but one day someone on the mailing list asked
if people with their own bands could submit cover songs.  At first it was only a
few people, but then as the numbers grew the project did as well - ending up
as a 2-CD tribute, one disc containing all of the multimedia data and the other
containing the 14 covers submitted.</P>
<P>In any case, the deadline kept moving back since the project kept growing, but
in July 1999 the deadline was August 1, so I didn't have much time to figure out,
transcribe, and record "In the Shadow of the Horns", which is my favorite DT song.
I didn't have time (at the time) to figure out the real ending of the song (the
acoustic guitar arpeggios over the raging undercurrent), so I decided to tack on
a few other riffs from other songs on the <I>A Blaze...</I> album; luckily I didn't
tread on anyone else's toes, since nobody opted to cover "A Blaze..." or "Paragon
Belial".
</P>
<P>One noteworthy thing about this song is that it was the first time I used my
(new at the time) Jackson Rhoads V.  I just bought that guitar in June - up until
then I had been using the now-infamous powder-blue Warlock...</P>

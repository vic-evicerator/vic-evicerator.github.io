<h2>Vic Speaks - about his weapons of choice</H2>

One thing I always liked about those 'guitar for the practicing musician'-type
magazines was how they would get into the nitty-gritty of the kinds of equipment
guitarists use.  Playing is one thing, but ultimately anyone can learn it with
enough work.  Wondering what gets that tone, though, or how that sound got made,
or how to get the most out of this effects unit, crap like that is more helpful.
</P><P>
Of course, with mainstream players, it's all ridiculously easy.  "Well, I got this
endorsement deal with this company and they just gave me this shit for free...", or
"I plunked down $3000 for this guitar...".  Music seems to be the only area where 
you really CAN solve a problem just by throwing money at it.  That's little help to
the home musician or those on tight budgets.  No guitar company is going to make a 
"Joe Schmoe" artist-line guitar just for Joe Schmoe - we have to deal with what's on
the rack and what we can afford (or can hock enough to afford).  That's why I like
to hear from the 'small guys' I'm in contact with and see the kinds of gear they use,
how they go about recording stuff, and crap like that.</P><P>
Maybe this will interest SOMEBODY.  Anyway, here I'll talk about the various guitars and
basses I've used.  Why?  Just because I can...  Since I started on Bass, I'll start with
 my basses...
</P><P>
My first bass was a tiny little no-name shortscale bass that I can't even remember.
My second was a full-size bass by a company named Mako.  I don't have any pictures of either
of them and they're both long-gone, so I have nothing to show for them.  Oh well.  My first
REAL bass was a Squier P-bass:</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><A href="images/pbass.jpg"><img border=1 src="images/pbasst.jpg"></A></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>My long-owned and much-cherished P-bass.  All the stickers
appeared during 1993-96 from various sources (mostly leftover titles from KMFDM stickers that
one of my former bandmates used for his guitar...).  Newer Squiers have the vintage flowing-style
script, chrome knobs, and a J-style pickup configuration (split coil and single-bar-style) - 
this is a Korean-made model from 1991 which had single split coil Powersound pickup.
For a couple of years I had replaced the E-string tuner with a Hipshot, but in 1995 replaced
it with the original tuner.</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>
I got this baby brand-new in 1991.  Aside from installing and then removing a Hipshot D-tuner,
and putting on all those stickers, I haven't modified it in the least.  I guess I lucked
into it.  It's a very sturdy, road-worthy bass that served as my main instrument for years,
and it's got a great sound.  It's balanced and easy to play.  For quite a while it was
my only bass.
</P><P>
About 1993 I wanted to get something else, and because I was in a prog-band at the time
I wanted to branch out and get a 5-string.  Everyone else was, why not?  I did some
shopping and the Ibanez Soundgear 5 (SR885 was the exact model number) did the trick.
I ended up getting it about Bastard-mas time 1993, I think.:</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><A href="images/sr885.jpg"><img border=1 src="images/sr885t.jpg"></A></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>This is a catalog picture of the SR885.  Mine was a 1993
model I think - the year after I got my SR885 was when they started adding a midrange-boost 
knob/switch to the active electronics setup on them, so mine was the last of the 'old' models.</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>
It was my first and last bass with active pickups, and I rather liked the two-octave neck
as well.  The sound, though, wasn't always the greatest.  I suppose for what I was playing
at the time it was okay, and I always tried to keep that 'hollow click' out of the sound
as much as I could, but I never fell in love with the tone.  I used it live on the songs
that needed the 5th string, but in the studio I think I only used it on one or two songs.
</P><P>
Towards the end of 1995 I was just idly shopping in a music store and saw a bass I just
HAD to have - an Ibanez Destroyer II:</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><A href="images/destroyer.jpg"><img border=1 src="images/destroyert.jpg"></A></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>This is my Destroyer - a 1984 model DT870 Destroyer II bass.
The pickup config is a bridge humbucker, a single coil, then a split coil in that box-cover near
the neck.  The big switch on the arm is a pickup selector, the small switch above the knobs must
be a coil splitter for the humbucker, and the knobs from top to bottom in this picture are
Volume, pickup mix, and tone (I think).  The silver string guide on the headstock is a mod I added myself
because the A-string was not fretting out at the nut, so I needed a guide to depress the angle of
that string behind the nut so it would work properly.
</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>I put it on layaway that day, then promptly sold the 5 string to come up with the rest of
the money for it.  It has a longer than standard scale length, and with three pickups and 
selector switches and blend-knobs, it has a pretty wide variety of tone.  At that time I
was in my thrash band Skiptoe, and we were tuning down to D, so this bass was perfect
for it.  Still, I didn't record as much as I should have with this bass in Skiptoe, but
when I started doing Rampage for real this was pretty much the only bass I used for 
a long time.  It's got an edgier, more harsh sound that contrasts nicely with the more
warm P-bass sound.
</P><HR>
<P>
Now, my guitars.  I borrowed several guitars from my roommates (who were also bandmates)
as I taught myself to play back in the early 90s.  Frank was an Ibanez enthusiast who
had a nice 540R "Radius" and an RG760.  I liked the Radius better, I think, just because
of the fatter neck and more rounded body style.  Weird, because my first guitar had a flat,
wide neck more like that RG - that first guitar being the now-infamous "Powder Blue Warlock":</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A href="images/pbwarlock.jpg"><Img border=1 src="images/pbwarlockt.jpg"></A></P></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>An old pic of me holding the beast up for display.  
Yes, that's my hand on the neck.  I told you the color was hideous.... I don't know
the actual model number, except that it was a Platinum series.  Volume is toward the neck, and
tone towards the rear.  Between them is a pickup selector, and the switch to the side is the
coil splitter.</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
I got this baby just when I quit Skiptoe in 1996.  I knew I'd be doing the home-recording
solo thing, and I didn't need a full bass rig anymore but DID need a guitar.  The guitarist/singer
Danny (who would end up being the bassist after I left) wanted one of my speaker cabinets,
and his family had just opened up a music store so I had quite a bit to trade from.  Sort of.
Lots of no-name things, some crap, and some real guitars that were way to nice for me.  And
then the Warlock - it was a BC Rich Platinum series, but was kinda beat-up: the nut on it
had been replaced improperly and one of the fine tuner screws was broken.  Still, a few bucks'
worth of repair work on the nut and a trip to the hardware store for the right size screw
later and I had a workable beast.
</P><P>
And BOY did I make that motherfucker work.  As it was my only guitar, it was all I used
in all those boombox recordings and all of the records up to "Bellum".  That was when
fate threw me a reward for making me suffer through using that thing for so long.  Of course,
the bitch still made me work for it, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do...
</P><P>
This was when a friend-of-a-friend type thing happened and I got invited to do the liner notes
for the Grim Reaper best-of that RCA released in 1999.  I got paid $500 for it, which was
just enough for a modest new guitar with case - so I went shopping at Mars Music (RIP)
and came out with a Jackson Rhoads-style V:
</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><A href="images/jackson_v.jpg"><img border=1 src="images/jackson_vt.jpg"</A></P></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>My Jackson V.  So far I haven't been able to track down the actual
model name/number, though I thought I was close on a Jackson archive site.  I like the no-pickguard
and sleek minimal control look.  The only knob is volume, and the pickup switch incorporates both
pickup selection and coil splitting in a five-way switch.  Also, sharkteeth beat the hell out of dots.
</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>It looked great, it sounded great, and it had one of those big fat necks like that
old Radius I learned on so many ages ago.  Once I got this I never looked back, and only
pulled the Warlock out of retirement for two or three songs until it got sold.
</P><P>
That Warlock got sold to make room, really, because I used the V so much that it was like
I only had one guitar anyway.  I wanted a second guitar, though, a fixed bridge, and
for some reason I got the Tony Iommi bug and decided I had to have some variation of the
SG.  I shopped for a while and found an Epiphone line SG-type (the G-400, standard; not
Goth, not Special, not Iommi-line, the standard one) that I loved.  The black one had 
big pearl trapezoid inlays and lots of chrome, and a black pickguard with the layered-white
border on the beveled edge.  It looked sharp, was affordable, and the bonus was that it
was a neck-thru design.  I fell in love, shopped for bargains, saved my pennies, and
then lucked into a "Buy it NOW!"-E-bay auction for one.  The super-duper bonus on this was
the case was included and the guy was local to Atlanta, so I could avoid the shipping cost
and delay by picking it up in person.  I firmly believe I was meant to own that guitar:
</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center><P>&nbsp;</P><A href="images/sg.jpg"><img border=1 src="images/sgt.jpg"</A></TD>
<TD align=left valign=center><P><I>Epiphone G-400 Standard SG.  It has the basic
independent volume/tone controls for each pickup and the LP-style toggle switch for pickups.
You can't see from this angle, obviously, but it's a neck-thru design, which surprised me
on a guitar this inexpensive.  Of the three different pickguard configurations on these Epiphone
SGs, this is my favorite - the larger ones that totally cover both pickups are too 'vintage'-looking, 
and the bare models look too naked.  The tri-layer bevel is another sharp touch, as are the 
trapezoidal pearl inlays.</I></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
I got it and immediately started using it, heavily.  It's got a weird neck - wide and kinda
thin but not anywhere near as thin as the RG/Warlock necks.  So far I've only just
started using it, but I'm sure it will get a lot of mileage on it really quickly, as it's
the best guitar I ever played.
</P><P>
Next up: Amps and effects.  But that's another whole article....
</P>
<P>For now, though, I'll finish up by itemizing what got used on what.  Why? Because I can...
<UL>
<LI><B>All those old boombox demos:</B> the Warlock (no bass, remember?)</LI>
<LI><B>Misogyny (April-June 1998):</B> All guitars were the Warlock, and all the 
bass tracks were done with the Destroyer.</LI>
<LI><B>This End Up (June-October 1999):</B> All guitars on the Warlock, almost
all bass tracks with the Destroyer.  I remember trying some bass tracks with
the P-bass, but I don't think I kept any of those takes.</LI>
<LI><B>Doom Metal single (early 1999):</B> Again, all guitars were done with the Warlock
and all the bass tracks were done with the Destroyer.</LI>
<LI><B>Cummin' Atcha Live (Mid-1999):</B> The last hurrah for the Warlock/Destroyer team.</LI>
<LI><B>Darkthrone Tribute track (June 1999):</B> This was the first track I recorded with
the Jackson V.  I used the Destroyer for the bass tracks.</LI>
<LI><B>Bellum Infinitum (June-December 1999):</B> The Jackson was so great I used it for every
single guitar track.  The first takes of all bass tracks were done with the P-bass, since
I hadn't used it in so long.  However, for some reason (probably a shitty soundcard), the
low end got lost, so I ended up re-tracking almost all the bass tracks with the Destroyer.
The only P-bass bass track I kept was "Soulsword", and maybe "The Vow" (I can't remember
anymore).  The acoustic guitar in "The Wakening" was a combination of my Fender acoustic
and a programmed MIDI guitar (not bad, eh?)</LI>
<LI><B>Hellhammer Tribute (December 2000):</B> Jackson/Destroyer.</LI>
<LI><B>New World Blasphemy (April/May 2001):</B> Jackson/Destroyer.</LI>
<LI><B>Monolith (August-November 2001):</B> All the guitars were done with the Jackson
originally.  There was an intonation problem I noticed while listening to "Neptune's Realm",
though, so instead of fixing the guitar I just used the Warlock again to rerecord the 
guitars on that one song.  The bass tracks I split up between the P-bass and the
Destroyer, just depending on what I felt like using the day I did the songs.  Doomsayer, 
Cursed with Existence, Wheels of Confusion are definitely all P-bass.  (Cursed is unique
in that it's the first time in literally years that I used fingers instead of a pick to
play the bass tracks).  The Mayhem cover is definitely the Destroyer, and I think Wanderlust
and Doom Metal are too.  Both Whitechapel and Neptune's Realm switch between the two, as
I started noticing intonation errors on the Destroyer tracks so, again, instead of fixing it
I just switched basses.  With Whitechapel it was easy - the first and last parts are all
Destroyer, but the middle part (from Dark Annie through the fast Long Liz/Catherine Eddowes
part) is the P-bass.  I might have replaced all of the Destroyer parts on Neptune's Realm
with the P-bass - I know the verses/clean parts are the Destroyer.</LI>
<LI><B>Beherit cover (early 2002):</B> Jackson for the guitars, and I'm pretty sure
it was the P-bass.</LI>
<LI><B>Countess cover (January 2004):</B> Jackson for the guitars, P-bass for the
bass.</LI>
<LI><B>Displeasures (March 2004):</B> I used the Jackson for Doomsayer but used
the new SG for the title song and the Sabbath cover.  Lance borrowed my P-bass
for all the tracks, and Axe used his Ibanez Destroyer for his guitar tracks.</LI>

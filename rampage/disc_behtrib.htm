<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Salomon's Gate</I></B>:</P>
<P>This album was ChorazaiM's idea, basically.  We were talking one day, the
subject of the flood of tributes came up, and he noticed that nobody
had done a Beherit tribute before - and then said that we should do
one.  He organized many of the bands, I did the rest, and we asked our
little group of bands for someone who could do art to do the cover - that
ended up being Eric M. Syre.</P>
<P>
As for Rampage's own contribution, there's not much to it - I liked the
<I>Drawing Down the Moon</I> album best, and knew that everyone would go
for "The Gate of Nanna", so I figured something else was in order.  Lyrics
only exist for a handful of the tracks, and those had been earmarked for
covers by other bands as well...  I ended up picking Salomon's Gate because
it was unpicked, because it was the opener on DDTM and thought it would be a 
good way to open this album as well, and because it had a lot of variation in
tempo and structure throughout and thought it came closest to Rampage's
style of music.  As for the lyrics, I tried to make them out as best I could
and then was forced to fill in the rest John-Tardy-style.

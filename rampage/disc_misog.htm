<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Misogyny, Thy Name is Woman</I></B>:</P>
<P>This EP was the first "full-band" demo, and since
I was still learning how to record and use the studio software it 
shows in the production.  It's the least serious in terms of songs, so
that turns off some metal fans or gives the impression that everything by
Rampage was less-than-serious.  Still, I have a soft spot for this demo
since it was the first thing I ever fully recorded on my own, and it
was gratifying to hear that I could make one person could sound like 
a full band.</P>
<P>The songs are mostly 'odds and ends', since I wrote most of them at very
different times and they were really just the songs that didn't fit
anywhere else (they weren't satanic/death metal enough for <I>This End
Up</I>, doomy enough for <I>Doom Metal</I>, and weren't part of the story
of <I>Bellum Infinitum</I>).  The only exception, of course, is "Bloody Leg".
I had finished recording the other six songs and had started working on
two more to get a head start on <I>This End Up</I> - by the time I was
mixing "Bloody Leg" had already been finished so I decided to throw it
on as a teaser for the upcoming album.</P>
<P>Am I embarrassed by it now? Yes.  Do I wish it had never gotten out?  I'm
not sure.  I guess in an ideal world I would have people take it as a different
band (which it was, in the way it was written anyway), but I'm neurotic about
having "Rampage" appear as the name on anything I do with music, and I guess
I trust too much that people can see something that is done as a joke as a joke
in itself without really looking at the whole band as something less than
serious.  Ah well, I dug my grave, now I'll lie in it.  And at least chuckle
at the bitches who inspired all this...  fuck it, I'll blame it on them - it's their
fault anyway.  They ruined my life then, and they ruined my music too.  Bitches....

<P><B>Aerik's thoughts on <I>Misogyny, Thy Name is Woman</I>:</B></P>
<P>This second demo I found to be quite fun, but utterly pointless to Vic's artists
designs.  I love the riffs and the silly put-on "teenage anger" lyrics for what 
they are...but really, Vic had such better material in his system that I don't think
this is worth chasing after unless you are like me...the Rampage diehard fanatic of
doooooom!  (...Or not...)

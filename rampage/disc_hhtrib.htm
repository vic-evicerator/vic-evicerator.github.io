<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Apocalyptic Raids 2001 C. E.</I></B>:</P>
<P>Not too long after I managed to get Megiddo
signed to UHR, ChorazaiM and I discussed doing some kind of split release, and one
of the best ideas we had (and quickest to complete) was a split tribute - pick a 
classic release (preferably a short one) and split the tracklist in half, each 
band covering their part, and
then putting it back together just like the original release with sufficiently
'tribute-ized' artwork.  At the top of the short list was Hellhammer's Apocalyptic
Raids EP.  We picked tracks and got to work.</P>
<P>I finished Rampage's three picks, "Massacra", "Whorus/Aggressor", and "Messiah"
back in December of 2000.  The recording went very quickly with no hitches, from 
what I remember.  The only real hangup was that Megiddo had gotten signed to
Barbarian Wrath in the meantime and had managed to put together a full band, so
between him working on artwork for BW releases, rehearsing, and recording
<I>The Devil and the Whore</I> for BW, he had little time to knock out his half.  Nevertheless
he and Blaspherion completed their three picks by May 2001 and the album was finished,
just in time to be released with <I>New World Blasphemy</I>.</P>

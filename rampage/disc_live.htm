<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Cummin' Atcha LIVE</I></B>:</P>
<P>For the first couple of months of 1999 I was helping Festering Sore to record
their "Fucked" demo and then putting the finishing touches on the Festering 
Sore/Rampage split.  Just after that I began working on the fleshing out, writing,
and programming for <I>Bellum Infinitum</I>.  Then I saw that Gortician managed
to get a 'live' gig on KCUF Internet Radio.  It was merely a practice tape that
Jason sent to Goat to get encoded and posted, but nevertheless it inspired me
to create a live album.  I thought at the time that doing so properly would
cement beyond refutation the 'full band' fiction that I had created.</P>
<P>I experimented for a bit with working the drums in stereo to get a more natural
'in the room' sound, and with using an actual microphone for the bass and guitars
instead of running them direct as I have always done before and since.  The first
results were promising, so I set to work crafting the live show.  Besides the
sound factors mentioned above, I rigidly set myself to performing the entire
'show' live, just like I would if it were a real show.  I did one take on
EVERYTHING, with absolutely no overdubs, playing all the songs in exactly the order
that they would appear on the final album.  Moreover, I concocted 'spontaneous'
moments, like shifting from one song to another right in the middle, including
liberal amounts of cover songs, etc.  The intent was to include all of the
sorts of things I liked about my favorite live albums of the past, and in
that I think I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
This album was not immune to gremlins either - After recording this, while all I
had at the time was a rough mix on cassette, I got the opportunity to contribute to
a Darkthrone tribute.  In the middle of trying to set up to record for this I had a fatal
problem with my studio software and had to reformat/reinstall.  However, I didn't back
up properly before doing this and so I lost EVERYTHING for the live album.  Fortunately,
the rough mix I had was good enough, so I put that onto CDR and put it out.

<P><B>Aerik's thoughts on <I>Cummin' Atcha LIVE</I>:</B></P>
<P>Well, "Cummin' Atcha Live" is the funniest, and possibly most 'up and down' of the
entire Rampage catalog.  Vic will hate me for saying this, but the "Storm over Avalon"
contained on this CD is far superior in aggression and mix than the slightly too
melodic version that exists on Bellum Infinitum...though more on that when we cross
that bridge.
</P>
<P>
This record has Vic's single worst vocal performance, some heavy-as-fuck riffing
and it saves some of the tracks from the original demos and re-releases them in 
a more listenable format.  Overall, this is fun and disposable in the 'live album'
sort of way (I still usually play the version of "Storm over Avalon") quite a bit
though.  This CD is worth it for the hardcore, and has some fun moments...but it truly
marks a 'bridge' period for Vic as the best was yet to come very shortly.
</P>
<P>
Maybe one day Vic and I will release a proper live album, with even more difficult
covers, a punchier mix and a little less (or more) chemical assistance.
</P>
<P>
I for one, think the cheap porn on the cover is disgusting...where did they find those
women?!</P>

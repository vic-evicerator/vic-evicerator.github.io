<H3>Vic's Thoughts on <I>Bellum Infinitum</I></H3>

<DIV class="narrow"> <!-- Width DIV START -->

<P>In those old Boombox demotapes is buried a concept EP.  I thought that was funny, since
when people do concept works they always do full albums or double albums or triple albums,
never something SHORTER.  Well, with that kind of a sense of humor, you can see why I left
humor behind.  But I digress...</P>
<P>I had an idea for a story that goes all the way back to my childhood, when I was one of 
those nerdy kids who played D&D with his friends.  The main character, the basic story arc, 
and the idea of the sword Untwain all came from those sleepless nights, but the story
itself was new.  I thought about all the concept albums out there where good fights evil,
but why doesn't anyone do one where EVIL fights GOOD?  A summary of this kind of story
was in the song "Storm Over Avalon", one of the oldest songs on here, which was written for
one of my old bands in about 1993 or so.  The only song on here that is older is "Excalibur",
which again uses some of the same ideas, and is actually from the 'original' Rampage lineup.
I fleshed out the music quite a bit, of course, but the basic idea is there.  With those two
songs I had the start of something, so I sketched out the rest of the story in broad strokes
and then wrote "Rainbow Skies", "Sisters of Death", and "The Final Day".  Those five songs 
together made the first version of the "Bellum Infinitum" EP which Paul and I bashed out
in 1996.</P>
<P>I listened to it, of course, and liked what I had, but still heard that there was more
of a story to it, so I wrote more - "Soulsword" and "The Vow" came next, and a little 
guitar jam that Paul and I did on another old tape re-worked itself into the intro of
"Soulsword", after being renamed from "The Last Hurrah" to "The Wakening".  We re-recorded
this seven-song version in 1997, and I was somewhat happier, but I could still hear that
most of the music here called for more than two people and a boombox could do.  I always
figured that someday I'd start my own studio and multitrack the whole thing, eventually....</P>
<P>When I started bashing out the solo Rampage stuff in 1998 I knew "Bellum..." would get
done someday, but I really got impatient to hear it after hearing the vast jump in quality
from "This End Up" to the "Doom Metal" single - so I shelved what I had at the time for the
Doom Metal album (just three songs and a few ideas) and started programming in 
earnest early in 1999.  I took a bit of time off to bash out the live album, but once that was
finished, in June or July 1999, I dove in full-bore.  All of the Keyboards and layering I wanted
to do strained my knowledge of my software and MIDI to the limit, but it ended up working out.
Sometime while writing and tracking out the other songs I had the idea to include one more
song - Nemesis.  Originally, this was a song from one of my old bands, written by the guitarist,
hastily learned and then almost as hastily ditched.  I always liked the song as it had a very
dark feel to it, and then I just somehow decided I should work it into this album.  I
only knew the bassline, so I had to re-create the guitar parts just from memory, and of course
I re-wrote the lyrics myself to fit the story.</P>
<P>I finished the album and had it released on Dec. 27, 1999,
and I was never so happy as on that day; I really feel like I stretched my
musical and technical abilities with it, and it was (and still is) gratifying
to hear the fruition of a project that was over ten years in the making.  If I
never produce another piece of music in my life I'll still die fulfilled, thanks
to <I>Bellum...</i>.</P>

<H3>Aerik's Thoughts on <I>Bellum Infinitum</I></H3>
<P>There is so much to say about this record.  Musically, it's perfect!  Vocally, 
it's a tad...tame.  I think that Vic hit a songwriting apex with this one that he 
is only reaching again now.  I hope I've helped with this process, of course.  
Bellum rocks like crazy and with great production and Iron Maiden riffing on 
storms like "Sisters of Death" and "Storm over Avalon" where can you really go 
wrong (other than some pained off-the-world vocal tracks.)
</P><P>
I really like this record a lot still (though I prefer the guitar layout for 
"Storm..." on Cummin' Atcha Live better!) and I spin it at least once a week.  
This record was the one that convinced me the Vic could make serious music, 
it was also the record in which I imagined myself doing releases, and lending 
my voice to the cause.  Bellum is a classic in it's own right, and, in my 
opinion, it's one of the finer actual "power metal" releases ever released on 
a compositional level.
</P><P>
Who knows...we may redo the vocals one day and do a mega-re-release of the 
CD!!!  Who knows?

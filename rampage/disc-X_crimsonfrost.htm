<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Crimson Frost</I></B>:</P>

<P>Sometimes I wonder what the hell I did to Fate to piss her off so much.</P>

<P><I>Crimson Frost</I> has been one of the most problematic releases I've ever
had the displeasure to conceive, write, record, and shop for release.  I must
have written about 15 songs that are now dead or in tiny little pieces scattered
to the four winds.  And those are just the ones that got far enough to write.  I 
changed focus on this about half a dozen times until I got Aerik in the band, 
and then he finally beat me into shape enough to get buckled down and finish it.
Then, of course, you probably all know the ups and downs of getting it released...
</P>

<P>And, now that it's out, I have to say I don't hate it.  Fate just kept fucking
with me, but I finally fucked her back by putting this out.  Maybe she was just
telling me that UHR still had some blood left in it.</P>

<P>She could've been nicer about it though...</P>

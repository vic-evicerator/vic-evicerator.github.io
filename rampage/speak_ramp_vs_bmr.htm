<h2>Aerik Speaks - about songwriting: Rampage versus Black Moon Rising</H2>
<HR>
<TABLE width=60%><TR><TD>
<P>
A lot of people have been asking me about the differences in the
creative/performance process between Black Moon Rising and Rampage.  It’s
something I never really thought about before, as both have been very
different.  So different, that I didn’t even make note that they existed in the
same universe of performance, writing and thought.  It’s like comparing the
affects of a guided missile to a roadside bomb.  Both kill the enemy just as
well – but one is conceived of thought and direction – the other is a raw
attempt at terror that might not kill the intended target...but makes such a mess
that few care WHO it destroyed in the end.
</P><P>
Needless to say...Rampage is a guided bomb built of the highest technology and
Black Moon Rising is like a roadside bomb that randomly goes off with little in
the way of pre-conceived study and development.
</P><P>
When I am writing for Rampage I tend to sit, and reflect on various happenings
and stories I’ve logged in my various journals and notebooks.  The process for
Rampage is to construct a person out of lyrics and music.  When thinking of
ideas to give Vic and I actively creating and fine-tuning a vibe or "persona"
for the song.  For "Letters From Hell" (the upcoming Rampage opus) I am
creating a vast array of "people" whom all bear some sort of painful secret. 
This secret of course is a "sin" that has landed each one of these people into
a metaphorical "hell".  The end result (hopefully) will be a lyric-scape that
will allow the listener to explore the land of secrets, personal "crimes" and
the socially repressed parts of the human mind.  In this case you may see drug
addicts, sex addicts, adulterers and other people whom externally appear
"normal" but bear a burden that casts them as internally mishappen.  I am
interested in that which torments or burdens man, or cause him to hunger at the
level of a full-blown addiction.  That which a man is passionate about drives
him to do what others are driven to judge.
</P><P>
Speaking of addiction...the "teaser" track on the new E.P. illustrates the above
described process perfectly.
</P><P>
In "Displeasures of the Flesh" I created an anthem for the people of addiction. 
The addiction presented in the song itself doesn’t matter but the basic IDEA of
addiction does.  I dwelled on my personal obsessions with drugs, alcohol and
occasional womanizing as well as trying to capture the feeling of the
"unhealthy" need for ALL things.  An addiction to presenting oneself as the
perfect moral guardian, an addiction to heroin or an addiction to public
praises all present the same basic issue.  You NEED that fix to get by on a day
to day basis.  Often we have appreciations for certain items to feel human.
</P><P>
Sometimes those items develop an appreciation for you return.
</P><P>
When things hit this point a man is lost to his love, and is instead of slave
that finds no gain in what he desires to do.  Needles, religion and fame all
become one blur of the pattern of day to day living.  The "Displeasures of the
Flesh" are that pattern.  Passion turns to routine, routine turns to poison.
</P><P>
The poison kills the man.
</P><P>
This is how one writes the lyrics to something such as "Displeasures of the
Flesh".
</P><P>
On the other hand...Black Moon Rising is based on my emotional impulses.  The
band is based on live firepower.  Songs come into place during moments of
emotion and passion that need to be captured that second.  "Dreamcatcher" was
written just after I have a horrible nightmare and "Built to Burn" was composed
after a moment of clarity in which I decided to keep fighting the evil fight in
music.  Black Moon Rising is not about reflection, but about "stream of
thought" expression.  This is an idea, due to the involved nature of
Rampage...that would be nearly impossible.
</P><P>
When I write for Black Moon Rising I explode on a seed that takes life almost
instantly.  Songs don’t take months to become final, they take moments in BMR. 
Sure – I’ll cobble a few things back together here and there and refine the
work...but no notebooks come into play and no hours of reflection take place. 
Black Moon Rising is the piss and vinegar in my spirit whilst Rampage is the
reflection and questioning.  I couldn’t have written the nasty riffcraft/lyrics
of "Heroin[e]" without feeling the need for that person in a singular moment. 
On the same hand, I couldn’t write with so much worry and utter spite as I did
in "Displeasures of the Flesh" with the rapid-fire aggression of BMR.
</P><P>
Two bands...two thought process...two entirely different worlds.
</P><P>
Rampage asks questions first and wonders if it should shoot before it deftly
removes the life of its prey.
</P><P>
Black Moon Rising asks no questions, tells no lies and fires every bullet until
everything in its sight is dead.
</P><P>
Till next time...

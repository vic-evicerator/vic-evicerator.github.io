<H3>Vic's Thoughts on <I>Crimson Frost</I></H3>

<DIV class="narrow"> <!-- Width DIV START -->
<P>
Before updating this page I saw that my thoughts on this release were all about
the hardships I had in writing and releasing it - the many abandoned and fruitless
song attempts, my constant focus-shifting as what I wanted to do with this release
kept changing depending on who I was listening to, and then the problematic
release issues (with the label who solicited us to release it then dropped us
after we kept having to talk them back into working with us...).
</P>
<P>
Rewriting this years later, though, I realized I had forgotten about most of this,
and what remains now when I think of this release is how proud I am of what we
accomplished here. Aerik really helped me focus on what makes black metal what
it is and, in doing so, helped me strip away the parts that were in the way of
us getting to that black, evil core of the music. It's also (so far) the only
live-drum release I've ever done with Rampage, and overall one that I think has
the most fitting production job I've ever put on one of our releases.
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of lessons from there that I think I've taken, and they'll
be invaluable going forward. Time will tell, I suppose.

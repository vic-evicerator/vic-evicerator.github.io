<P><B>Vic's thoughts on <I>Ticket to Hell / Rampage</I></B>:</P>
<P>I'll admit it - Brian Voth was an inspiration for this release.</P>
<P>Even with my non-profit-motive approach to music, I think it takes balls to just give
your shit away for free.  Unless, of course, your method of distribution is also free.
Brian, of course, has explicitly stated many times that Fireaxe's music is in the public
domain and can be freely distributed, but when you're talking about 75 minutes of music, 
the webspace and bandwidth become problems very quickly.  CDR-trading is encouraged, of course,
but that still has the limitations of time delay and physical media.  Filesharing is an option,
of course, and increasingly I've heard of people who got Fireaxe albums from DirectConnect
or Soulseek or whatever other share network.</P>
<P>And it got me thinking - why not tailor a release for internet-only distribution?</P>
<P>This idea quickly combined with a real project when Aerik joined Rampage, as he had
been a fan of the old songs for a long time and was eager to take a crack at redoing the vocals
for them.  And, honestly, I thought it would be a good way to rerecord the old stuff, since
I've learned A LOT about production and engineering since 1998, when my only thoughts were 'REDLINE'
and 'COMPRESS'.</P>
<P>So, Aerik and I picked a couple of tracks we could do quick-n-clean rerecordings of, updating
them with a new, better sound and the new lineup, and then make them available as a websingle - that way
those few freaks who still prefer my vox to his won't feel shat upon, and so anyone with the old
versions can just get the new ones for free.</P>
<P>Once these are released, we'll have a few different flavors for the various types of music
listeners: Your standard mp3 version will be under 10MB so it'll be easy to share or send via
G-mail.  Audiophiles will be able to enjoy better-than-mp3 OGG files, and the anal-retentive
types (and those who want to burn this for car/walkman listening) will be able to get a purely
lossless format (FLAC or APE) - complete, of course, with a DIY-printable insert and liner notes.</P>

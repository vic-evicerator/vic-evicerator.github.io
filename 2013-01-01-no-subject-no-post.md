*(I just need to put something here so that the by-year index shows a 2013. The reality is that I didn't blog a single thing in 2013 on any of my music blogs. I had more personal fish to fry, and the fact that it all worked out is a testament to my 'decision' to not write anything here - which is really just a byproduct of not working on anything but my own personal shit. I realize that this sounds a lot like those cryptic 'I've got a big secret I want to tell, but can't, or it's not really that important, but I'll make it SOUND important by being supposedly mysterious about how I word it' bullshit posts. For what it's worth, just accept that the 25 months between my last musical blog post and the next one were full of work that I needed to do on myself and my life, and in doing so I actually made it possible to keep doing this music thing. Not that, as I write this in September 2014, I've actually gotten anything completed to the point you can hear it, but without that absence I wouldn't even be able to say I'm ABLE to work on music.*

*It sucked, but I've gotten through it, we're all happier and better now, and now there's a person here who can feel enough to write a song, and is stable and enthusiastic enough to actually carry through.*

*But yeah, 25 months. Fuck, man.... I might have some stuff I did on my personal blog that's music-related-enough to share here. We'll see. But, in any case, fast forward to March 2014 now... --> )*

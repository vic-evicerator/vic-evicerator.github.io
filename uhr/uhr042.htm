   <H3>About this album</H3>
   <P>The first full-length release by Eyes of Ligeia sees Toby expand the
scope of the music.  More epic, more technical, more somber, more
black... This album perfectly capures the sound of a nightmarish
twilight falling...</P>
<P>This album was deleted from physical print June 7, 2004, but is now available on
 <A href="http://www.archive.org/details/uhr042" target=_top>The Bleeding Edge</A>.

<h3>Reviews</h3>
<DIV>
<P>
Most of you (especially you doom fanatics out there) should be familiar 
with Eyes of Ligeia, Georgia's reining (and only) doom/death metal band! 
Hell, EOL has been promoted numerous times in these pages and with good 
cause as, frankly, Eyes of Ligeia kicks fucking ass. 
<P>
Lucky 'zine editor that I am, Toby was kind enough to send a promo 
copy of his latest release, the full version of <I>The Night's 
Plutonian Shore</I> (of which the demo version was reviewed a couple 
issues back). This CD includes the three songs from that demo ("In 
the Place Where There Is No Darkness", "Nevermore" and "As the 
Twilight Fades Away"), "To Drown Beyond the Sunset" (from the debut 
MCD) plus two new compositions: "Khephra in Thy Hiding" and "Seraphs 
Uplifted with the Sun", both of which are absolutely stunning, epic 
doom metal pieces! 
<P>
Let's start with the sound. Whereas the prior three-song promo had a 
rather lop-sided production (hey, it <I>was</I> a demo), this full-length
- clocking in at just over fifty minutes - features a much more 
balanced recording. The drums are particularly well-programmed 
and sound much more "real" than on past material. Toby's vocals 
are as great as ever and his growling style lends a special 
ambiance to the music. Hell, I dare any of you to find another 
singer who sounds like he! 
<P>
Musically, these six songs show that Toby is quite an apt musician. 
He's really honed his skills since releasing the <I>A Dirge for the 
Most Lovely Dead</I> MCD in '99. I especially 
enjoy the way he seamlessly seques from those utterly mournful 
clean guitar passages to the heavier distorted segments. The two 
new songs are stunning. "Khephra. . ." actually has a clean guitar 
riff that sounds like it was taken from an older EOL song. This kind of 
despondency is just so rare in today's limp-wristed flower-happy 
"goth doom"-infested scene. 
<P>
If you buy (or download) only a few doom metal records this 
year, make sure <I>The Night's Plutonian Shore</I> is one of 
them or you'll miss out on one hell of an album. 
<P>
BEWARE: Eyes of Ligeia is suicide-inducing. 
<P>
Preferred tracks: all six - "As the Twilight Fades Away", "To Drown Beyond the Sunset", 
"Nevermore", "Khephra in Thy Hiding", "In the Place Where There Is No Darkness", 
"Seraphs Uplifted with the Sun"

Full length release from metal composer Toby Chappel. Six songs at 
just under an hour that will be some of the most wandering, meandering, 
churning epic doom that you're likely to hear this year unless 
THERGOTHON reform and release something. Think you've heard slow 
before? Try this one and see what slow is! While the songs tend 
to drone on with no real plan, there is a flow of misery and 
melancholy throughout. Be thankful razor blades aren't included 
with this release!

Judging from their moniker and album title, Eyes of Ligeia are heavily
influenced by Edgar Allan Poe. His melancholy tales and poems, replete with
grim, near horrific overtones, are a fitting influence for a doom metal record.
I'm surprised Poe hasn't exerted a greater influence over some of the more
sombre bands. Eyes of Ligeia is yet another one-man band on UHR. While I think
that the formation of many one-man bands is due in part to musical
pretentiousness (the "no-one has the same vision / understands me / can do it
as well as me" syndrome), Eyes of Ligeia's Toby demonstrates that he indeed
possesses the necessary talent to pull it off. The guitars produce an unusual,
high-pitched, almost artificial sound, almost as if it is trying to sound like
a keyboard imitating a guitar. Definitely different. The vocals too are
different from the norm: instead of sorrow-filled mournful clean vocals or
death style grunts, the vocalist utilises a whispery, high-pitched rasp.
Despite the unusual sounds, the slow mournful pace of the songs leaves no doubt
in my mind that this is a doom metal album. The song structures bring to mind
the likes of _As the Flower Withers_-era My Dying Bride whilst undeniably
retaining an aura of originality. Simply like no other doom metal band.
Unfortunately, Toby has put Eyes of Ligeia on hold at the moment as he
concentrates on his other project, Amphigory, which should also be worth a
listen or two.</P>
<P>7.5 out of 10</P>

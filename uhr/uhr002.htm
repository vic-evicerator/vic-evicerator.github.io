   <H3>About this album</H3>
<P>Vic told the tale of the recording from his perspective many years ago:
<BR><I>"Back in 1992 when I was still in Early Warning we had the good fortune
to play our first ever live show with fellow-Atlanta headbangers Disjecta 
Membra.  They went on right after us, and ironically it was their first ever
live show too!  They bowled me over with their opener "Earth and Stone" and
as the night went on they pummeled me mercilessly with slab after slab of
their own brand of heavy metal.</I></P>
<P><I>"Later that month a friend of mine who worked at the college radio station
where I was said that Disjecta Membra would be playing LIVE on the radio, and
I begged him to get me into the studio.  I arrived at about the same time they
did and talked with them as they set up, and then I sat enthralled as they 
played their guts out over the airwaves with me not even five feet away listening.
Later that night we hung out and drank beer listening to the tape of that show.
I got a copy that night but through various circumstances it disappeared.</I></P>
<P><I>"Four years later when I was in Skiptoe we were invited to play on Live at 
WREK, and while setting up I started talking to the soundman about Disjeca Membra
and he said "yeah, I've still got that DAT somewhere..."  Amazed, I signed my
soul away to him to get a copy of it, and when it arrived about three months later
I eagerly popped it in - and it was just as powerful as it was in person all
those years ago.  At that point I decided 'the world just HAS to hear this'...  
I still don't feel like anyone else has had quite the mix of metal styles that 
Disjecta Membra had, and that uniqueness has always been a goal of mine.  HAIL 
DISJECTA MEMBRA!</I></P>

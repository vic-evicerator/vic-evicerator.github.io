   <H3>About this album</H3>
   <P>Ultra-raw black metal that's 
evil as fuck, primitive, but still epic in a way - imagine Beherit playing
mid-era Bathory and recording on a boombox.  That's this album.  Hail Satan.

Ah, the memories of the 80s tape trading scene come flooding  back, when
bands recorded demos on a portable tapedeck in the corner of their 
bedroom and spread them across the globe via the C90 cassette.  Gomorrah 
sound authentic, even down to the hum of the motor in the quiet passages
and the  clatter of the stop button being pressed after each track.
</P><P>
Like the early  Death demos, this is just bass, drums and vocals, and
both albums follow the  same Hellhammer, slow Dark Throne, early Beherit
pattern, with the "NOTBP"  tracks being slightly longer than those on
"IPOTDL".
</P><P>
Under-rehearsed, sloppy  and terribly recorded, Gomorrah fly in the face
of convention.  Fans of  early death thrash will be delighted by them.

<P>Great original band name, huh? Cool demo title, though. I really wanted to like
this band, but just. . .didn't. Gomorrah plays black metal of the rawest
persuasion and, while that may sound good to you, it isn't. The production is
perfectly fine--very rough and demo-like. The problem is, the drumming is
extremely stilted and sloppy, the vocals are way too nasal and the guitars seem
to only be able to play a few riffs each song, and not that well, I might add.
However, I believe this is Gomorrah's debut demo, so there is still plenty of
time for improvement. Hopefully their next release will be tighter and,
frankly, they could use the practice. Raw black metal is great, but it only
works when there is existing musicianship!
